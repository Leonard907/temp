The U.S. Special Operations Command (USSOCOM), headquartered at MacDill Air Force Base in Tampa, FL, is a functional combatant command responsible for training, doctrine, and equipping for all U.S. SOF units. The Assistant Secretary of Defense for Special Operations and Low Intensity Conflict (ASD SOLIC), a member of the Office of the Secretary of Defense for Policy (OSD-P), provides civilian oversight over USSOCOM activities and is chain of supervision between the Secretary of Defense and USSOCOM Commander. The current ASD SOLIC is Owen West. As of 2019, USSOCOM consists of over 70,000 active duty, reserve, National Guard, and civilian personnel assigned to its headquarters (about 2,500 personnel), its four components, and sub-unified commands. USSOCOM's components are the U.S. Army Special Operations Command (USASOC); the Naval Special Warfare Command (NSWC); the Air Force Special Operations Command (AFSOC); and the Marine Corps Forces Special Operations Command (MARSOC). The Joint Special Operations Command (JSOC) is a USSOCOM sub-unified command. Theater Special Operations Commands (TSOCs) are sub-unified commands under their respective Geographic Combatant Commanders (GCCs). TSOCs are special operational headquarters elements designed to support a GCC's special operations logistics, planning, and operational command and control requirements, and are normally commanded by a general officer. In February 2013, based on a request from USSOCOM and with the concurrence of every geographic and functional combatant commander and military service chiefs and Secretaries, the Secretary of Defense transferred combatant command of the TSOCs from the GCCs to USSOCOM. This means USSOCOM has the responsibility to organize, train, and equip TSOCs, as it previously had for all assigned SOF units as specified in U.S. Code, Title 10, Section 167. This change is intended to enable USSOCOM to standardize, to the extent possible, TSOC capabilities and manpower requirements. While USSOCOM is now responsible for the organizing, training, and equipping of TSOCs, the GCC",
    "crs_R45636": "Since the founding, the federal courts have played a critical role in adjudicating legal disputes, including those involving executive action. As the Supreme Court stated in Marbury v. Madison, \"where a specific duty is assigned by law.. the individual who considers himself injured[] has a right to resort to the laws of his country for a remedy.\" Naturally, Congress and its Members have an interest in litigating in federal court, for example, to vindicate their institutional priorities, to argue that the Executive is violating their legislative prerogatives, or to advance their legislative policy interests. During the Obama Administration, for instance, legislative entities brought or joined litigation in federal court for a host of reasons, such as to challenge the Executive's decision to allegedly expend money without a congressional appropriation, to defend the Defense of Marriage Act from constitutional challenge in lieu of the Executive, and to challenge the Executive's decision to engage in military action in Libya. Likewise, during the Trump Administration, legislators have become involved in lawsuits that challenge the President's alleged unconstitutional acceptance of emoluments, suits demanding the production of documents from the Administration, and, in an amicus capacity, challenges to legality of the so-called travel ban. Congressional interest in litigation may increase in salience under the current divided government, as illustrated by the House of Representatives' resolution to authorize the House to participate in ongoing litigation in Texas involving the Affordable Care Act and a recent lawsuit brought by several Members of Congress challenging the President's appointment of an acting Attorney General. However, whenever any party seeks to invoke the power of the federal courts, it must first show that its dispute belongs there. For nearly its entire history, the Supreme Court has emphasized that the role of courts is in \"decid[ing] on the rights of individuals.\" By contrast, \"[v]indicating the public interest (including the public interest in Government observance of the Constitution and laws) is the function of Congress and the Chief Executive.\" The federal courts apply a number of doctrines, known as justiciability doctrines, to ensure that they do not step beyond their bounds and decide issues more properly reserved for the other branches. Foremost among these doctrines is the requirement that a party seeking judicial relief from a federal court demonstrate \"standing.\" This report provides an overview",

Advances in science and technology can help drive economic growth and meet national priorities in public health, environmental protection, agricultural productivity, defense, and many other areas. Federal policies affect scientific and technological advancement on several levels. The federal government directly funds research and development (R&D) activities to achieve national goals or support national priorities, such as funding basic life science research through the National Institutes of Health (NIH) or developing new weapons systems in the Department of Defense (DOD). The federal government also establishes and maintains the legal and regulatory framework that affects S&T activities in the private sector. In addition, federal tax, trade, and education policies can have effects on private sector S&T activity.

These IHEs ranged in sector, size, and educational programs offered. Most of these IHEs operate from year to year with few severe financial or operational concerns; however, each year, a few do face such concerns, which may cause them to cease or significantly curtail operations. The recent closure of multiple large, proprietary (or private, for-profit) IHEs has brought into focus the extent to which a postsecondary student's education may be disrupted by a school closure. However, even in instances of a small IHE's closure, student concerns remain the same. Concerns include the following, among others: Can they continue their postsecondary education at another school? How will they finance future postsecondary educational pursuits? Are they liable for repaying loans they may have borrowed to pursue a postsecondary credential that they were unable to obtain because of an IHE's closure? This report provides an explanation of the options a postsecondary student may pursue in the event the IHE he or she attends closes, any financial relief that may be available to such students, and other practical implications for students following a school's closure. First, this report describes the academic options available to such students, such as participating in a teach-out or transferring to a new IHE. Next, it discusses issues related to financing a postsecondary education, including the extent to which borrowers may have any loans borrowed to finance educational expenses discharged due to a school closure and whether future financial assistance, including federal student loans, Pell Grants, and GI Educational Benefits, may be available to students should they decide to continue their postsecondary education at another IHE. This report then describes additional relief that may be available to students who attended IHEs that closed, such as the potential to have tuition paid reimbursed through a state tuition recovery fund. Finally, this report describes some potential income tax implications for students when their IHE has closed, including the extent to which they may incur a federal income tax liability",

Its purpose is to \"mobilize and facilitate the participation of private sector capital and skills in the economic development\" of developing and transition countries, in order to complement U.S. development assistance objectives and foreign policy interests. Not yet operational, the IDFC represents a potentially major overhaul of U.S. development finance efforts. The IDFC's enabling legislation is the Better Utilization of Investments Leading to Development Act of 2018 (BUILD Act), which was enacted on October 5, 2018, as Division F of a law to reauthorize the (unrelated) Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) (H.R. 302/P.L. 115-254). Under the BUILD Act, the IDFC is to consolidate and expand the U.S. government's existing development finance functions\u2014currently conducted primarily by the Overseas Private Investment Corporation (OPIC) and the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID). By statute, the IDFC is a successor agency to OPIC, which is to terminate when the IDFC is operational. The BUILD Act consolidates functions currently carried out primarily by OPIC and certain elements of USAID. The act established the new IDFC to be a successor entity to OPIC, taking over all of its functions and authorities and adding new ones. The IDFC's authorities would expand beyond OPIC's existing authorities to make loans and guarantees and issue insurance or reinsurance. They would also include the authority to take minority equity positions in investments, subject to limitations. In addition, unlike OPIC, the IDFC would be able to issue loans in local currency. The extent to which USAID functions will be transferred to the new IDFC is less clear. The act specifies that the Development Credit Authority (DCA), the existing legacy credit portfolio under the Urban and Environment Credit Program, and any other direct loan programs and non-DCA guarantee programs shall be transferred to the IDFC.

FVPSA programs are carried out by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services' (HHS's) Administration for Children and Families (ACF) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). ACF administers most FVPSA programming, including grants to states, territories, and Indian tribes to support local organizations that provide immediate shelter and related assistance for victims of domestic violence and their children. ACF also provides funding for a national domestic violence hotline that responds to calls, texts, and web-based chats from individuals seeking assistance. The funding for ACF also supports state domestic violence coalitions that provide training for and advocacy on behalf of domestic violence providers within each state, as well as multiple resource centers that provide training and technical assistance on various domestic violence issues for a variety of stakeholders. The CDC funds efforts to prevent domestic violence through a program known as Domestic Violence Prevention Enhancement and Leadership Through Allies (DELTA). The House Committee on Education and Labor and the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pension (HELP) Committee have exercised jurisdiction over FVPSA. The report begins with background on the definitions of domestic violence and related terms. This background section also describes the risk factors for domestic violence and estimates of the number of victims. The next section addresses the history leading up to the enactment of FVPSA, and the major components of the act: a national domestic violence hotline, support for domestic violence shelters and nonresidential services, and community-based responses to prevent domestic violence. The report then discusses efforts under FVPSA to assist children and youth exposed to domestic violence, including teen dating violence. Finally, the report provides an overview of FVPSA's interaction with other federal laws, including the Child Abuse Prevention and Treatment Act (CAPTA) and the Violence Against Women Act of 1994 (VAWA, P.L. 103-322). FVPSA was the first federal law to address domestic violence, with a focus on providing shelter and services for survivors; however, since the enactment of VAWA in 1994, the federal response to domestic violence has expanded to involve multiple departments and activities that include investigating and prosecuting",

The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS), an agency within the Department of the Interior, administers Pittman-Robertson as part of its Wildlife and Sport Fish Restoration program. Revenues generated through excise taxes on pistols and revolvers, other firearms, ammunition, bows, and other archery equipment provide the funding for Pittman-Robertson. After collection, receipts from these excise taxes are deposited into the Federal Aid to Wildlife Restoration Fund in the Treasury, and monies from the fund are made available for FWS for Pittman-Robertson activities in the fiscal year following their collection without any further action by Congress. For three programs within Pittman-Robertson, FWS apportions the funds directly among the states and territories. All 50 states as well as Puerto Rico, Guam, American Samoa, the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, and the U.S. Virgin Islands (collectively referred to as territories in this report) are eligible to receive funding through Pittman-Robertson. Since its creation, Pittman-Robertson has provided over $18.8 billion (in 2018 dollars; $12.2 billion in nominal dollars) to states and territories.

The discretion available to a Civil War President in his exercise of emergency power has been harnessed, to a considerable extent, in the contemporary period. Due to greater reliance upon statutory expression, the range of this authority has come to be more circumscribed, and the options for its use have come to be regulated procedurally through the National Emergencies Act. Since its enactment, the National Emergencies Act has not been revisited by congressional overseers. The 1976 report of the Senate Special Committee on National Emergencies suggested that the prospect remains that further improvements and reforms in this policy area might be pursued and perfected.",
    "crs_R40425": "Medicare is a federal program that pays for covered health care services of qualified beneficiaries. It was established in 1965 under Title XVIII of the Social Security Act to provide health insurance to individuals 65 and older, and has been expanded over the years to include permanently disabled individuals under 65. The program is administered by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS), within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). Medicare consists of four distinct parts: Part A (Hospital Insurance, or HI) covers inpatient hospital services, skilled nursing care, hospice care, and some home health services. The HI trust fund is mainly funded by a dedicated payroll tax of 2.9% of earnings, shared equally between employers and workers. Since 2013, workers with income of more than $200,000 per year for single tax filers (or more than $250,000 for joint tax filers) pay an additional 0.9% on income over those amounts. Part B (Supplementary Medical Insurance, or SMI) covers physician services, outpatient services, and some home health and preventive services. The SMI trust fund is funded through beneficiary premiums (set at 25% of estimated program costs for the aged) and general revenues (the remaining amount, approximately 75%). Part C (Medicare Advantage, or MA) is a private plan option for beneficiaries that covers all Parts A and B services, except hospice. Individuals choosing to enroll in Part C must also enroll in Part B. Part C is funded through the HI and SMI trust funds. Part D covers outpatient prescription drug benefits. Funding is included in the SMI trust fund and is financed through beneficiary premiums, general revenues, and state transfer payments. Medicare serves approximately one in six Americans and virtually all of the population aged 65 and older. In 2019, the program will cover an estimated 61 million persons (52 million aged and 9 million disabled). The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimates that total Medicare spending in 2019 will be about $772 billion; of this amount, approximately $749 billion will be spent on benefits. About 28% of Medicare benefit spending is for hospital inpatient and hospital outpatient services. CBO also estimates that federal Medicare spending (after deduction of beneficiary premiums and other offsetting receipts) will be about $637 billion in 2019, accounting for about 14% of total federal spending and 3% of GDP.

    "crs_R45242": "The National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) is the main provider of primary flood insurance coverage for residential properties in the United States, providing nearly $1.42 trillion in coverage for over 5 million residential flood insurance policies. In FY2018, the program collected about $3.5 billion in annual premium revenue, $1.1 billion in assessments, fees, and surcharges and $1.0 billion in payments from private reinsurers. Nationally, over 22,000 communities participate in the NFIP. The NFIP is designed to borrow money from the Treasury to cover claims for extreme events; however, the 2017 losses would have pushed the program over its authorized borrowing limit. Rather than increase the borrowing limit, in 2017, Congress canceled $16 billion of NFIP debt to allow the program to pay claims. Expanding the role of private insurers, including reinsurers, has been seen by many as an answer to the variability of the financial position of the NFIP. Increasing participation by private insurers, including reinsurers, could transfer more flood risk from policyholders to the private insurance sector, as opposed to transferring the risk to the federal government through the NFIP. In addition to the possible advantage to the NFIP, the increased availability of flood insurance as private companies enter the market may benefit households and businesses, as insured flood victims are likely to recover more quickly and more fully after a flood. Private insurer interest in directly providing and underwriting flood risk has increased in recent years. Advances in the analytics and data used to quantify flood risk along with increases in capital market capacities may allow private insurers to take on flood risks that they shunned in the past. However, increasing the private sector role in providing flood insurance coverage directly to consumers may have implications for the operations and fiscal solvency of the NFIP as currently structured. Increased access to private flood insurance could provide individual policyholders with a wider choice of coverage and possibly cheaper premiums, but may also lead to variable consumer protections. The extent to which private insurance companies participate in the U.S. flood insurance market represents an area of congressional concern. Both the 114th and 115th Congress addressed the issue with legislation passing the House; however, no legislation was ultimately enacted. The NFIP is currently operating under a short-term reauthorization until May 31, 2019. The 115th Congress also addressed the issue with legislation passing the House; however, no legislation was",

    "crs_R44804": "The existence and treatment of political prisoners in Burma (Myanmar) has been a central issue in the formulation of U.S. policy toward Burma for more than 25 years. The arrest, detention, prosecution, and imprisonment of Burmese political prisoners\u2014including Aung San Suu Kyi\u2014frequently were cited as reasons for imposing political and economic sanctions on Burma and the leaders of its ruling military junta. The release of political prisoners was often listed as a necessary condition for the repeal of those sanctions. When announcing waivers of existing sanctions, the Obama Administration often cited progress on the release of political prisoners as evidence for why the waiver was warranted. During a discussion of the human rights situation in Burma during the 34th session of the U.N. Human Rights Council in March 2017, William J. Mozdzierz, Director of the Office of Human Rights and Humanitarian Affairs within the State Department's Bureau of International Organization Affairs, stated that the U.S. government was \"concerned by new political arrests under the current [Burmese] government,\" and urged \"the [Burmese] government to immediately and unconditionally release all political prisoners, and to drop charges against individuals for taking part in protected political activities.\" What actions, if any, the 116th Congress or the Trump Administration may take with respect to U.S. policy toward Burma may hinge, in part, on the issue of political prisoners in Burma. Eight years have passed since Burma's ruling military junta, the State Peace and Development Council (SPDC), transferred power over to a newly reconstituted Union Parliament and President Thein Sein, a retired general and the SPDC's last Prime Minister. In 2016, Aung San Suu Kyi and the National League for Democracy (NLD) assumed control over the Union Parliament after NLD's landslide victory in the 2015 parliamentary elections. Although both the Thein Sein and NLD-led governments periodically pardoned political prisoners, authorities continue to arrest, detain, prosecute, and imprison people for peacefully expressing their political opinions. One reason that controversy over political imprisonment persists in Burma is the lack of agreement on the definition of \"political prisoner.\" Some in Burma",

    "crs_R43325": "The Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) mandates that U.S. transportation fuels contain a minimum volume of biofuel. The mandated minimum volume increases annually and must be met using both conventional biofuel (e.g., corn starch ethanol) and advanced biofuel (e.g., cellulosic ethanol). For a renewable fuel to be applied toward the mandate, it must be used for certain purposes (i.e., transportation fuel, jet fuel, or heating oil) and meet certain environmental and biomass feedstock criteria. A variety of factors, such as infrastructure, technology, and limited federal assistance, have led to challenges in meeting the total volume requirement established by Congress. These challenges have included a lack of cellulosic biofuel production and delays by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) in approving fuel pathways. Further, it is not clear how changes in gasoline consumption in response to fluctuating crude oil and gasoline prices impact the biofuel or conventional fuel industries. It is also uncertain how the program will fare once EPA implements the \"reset\" provision of the statute, which allows the agency to modify the volumes required for future years (starting in 2016) if certain conditions are met. In addition, some stakeholders have expressed concern about the transparency of the market wherein credits are traded to demonstrate compliance with the mandate. Lastly, there is concern by some biofuel producers that the Trump Administration's issuance of multiple small refinery exemptions has adversely affected, or will adversely affect, biofuel demand. There are, however, two fuel categories that have consistently met their statutory targets: conventional biofuel and biomass-based diesel. Also, since 2014, two advanced biofuel pathways\u2014renewable compressed natural gas and renewable liquefied natural gas\u2014have constituted the majority of the cellulosic biofuel volume target established by EPA. Challenges in implementing the RFS have led to scrutiny of the program in Congress and to litigation about EPA's regulations. Largely due to concerns about the implementation and feasibility of the RFS, some Members of Congress have expressed their perspectives on EPA's proposed and final rules as well as EPA's implementation of the program. They also have questioned whether to amend or repeal the RFS or whether to maintain the status quo.",

The United States and Russia signed their first formal agreements limiting nuclear offensive and defensive weapons in 1972. The United States and Soviet Union signed the Strategic Arms Limitation Treaty (SALT II), which sought to codify equal limits on U.S. and Soviet strategic offensive nuclear forces. The United States and Russia signed the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (START I), which limited each nation's forces to between 3,000 and 3,500 warheads. The United States and Russia signed the Strategic Offensive Reductions Treaty (START II), which limited each side to between 2,000 and 2,500 warheads for strategic offensive nuclear weapons. The United States and Russia signed the Strategic Offensive Reductions Treaty (START III), which limited each side to between 2,000 and 2,500 warheads for strategic offensive nuclear weapons on each side. The United States and Russia signed the New START Treaty in April 2010, and both have completed their required reductions. Russia, however, has raised concerns about the method that the United States has used to eliminate some of its accountable weapons, and has, therefore, been unwilling to agree, unequivocally that the United States is in compliance with the Treaty. The Trump Administration, like the Bush Administration, has voiced skepticism about the role that arms control and nonproliferation agreements can play in strengthening U.S. national security. This view reflects growing concerns about Russian compliance with existing arms control agreements, but also derives from the view that arms control does too much to restrict U.S. flexibility and too little to limit the capabilities of others. Moreover, while some would argue that growing tensions between the United States and Russia strengthen the case for further negotiated limits on U.S. and",

The NFIP lapsed between January 20 and January 22, 2018, and received a fourth short-term reauthorization until February 8, 2018. The NFIP lapsed for approximately eight hours during a brief government shutdown in the early morning of February 9, 2018, and was then reauthorized until March 23, 2018. The NFIP received a sixth reauthorization until July 31, 2018, a seventh reauthorization until November 30, 2018, an eighth reauthorization until December 7, 2018, a ninth reauthorization until December 21, 2018, and a tenth reauthorization until May 31, 2019. The last long-term reauthorization of the NFIP was by the Biggert-Waters Flood Insurance Reform Act of 2012 (hereinafter BW-12), from July 6, 2012, to September 30, 2017. Congress amended elements of BW-12, but did not extend the NFIP's authorization further, in the Homeowner Flood Insurance Affordability Act of 2014 (HFIAA). The NFIP is managed by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), through its subcomponent the Federal Insurance and Mitigation Administration (FIMA). As of October 2018, the NFIP had more than 5.1 million flood insurance policies providing over $1.3 trillion in coverage. The program collects about $3.6 billion in annual premium revenue. Nationally, as of January 2019, about 22,355 communities in 56 states and jurisdictions participated in the NFIP. According to FEMA, the program saves the nation an estimated $1.87 billion annually in flood losses avoided because of the NFIP's building and floodplain management regulations. The NFIP accomplishes the goal of reducing comprehensive flood risk primarily by requiring participating communities to develop and adopt flood maps called Flood Insurance Rate Maps (FIRMs).

Section 232 authorizes the President to impose restrictions on certain imports based on an affirmative determination by the Department of Commerce (Commerce) that the targeted products are being imported into the United States \"in such quantities or under such circumstances as to threaten to impair the national security.\" Section 232 investigations and actions are important for Congress, as the Constitution gives it primary authority over international trade matters. In the case of Section 232, Congress has delegated to the President broad authority to impose limits on imports in the interest of U.S. national security. The statute does not require congressional approval of any presidential actions that fall within its scope. In the Crude Oil Windfall Profit Tax Act of 1980, however, Congress amended Section 232 by creating a joint disapproval resolution provision under which Congress can override presidential actions in the case of adjustments to petroleum or petroleum product imports. Section 232 is one of several tools the United States has at its disposal to address trade barriers and other foreign trade practices. These include investigations and actions to address import surges that are a \"substantial cause of serious injury\" or threat thereof to a U.S. industry (Section 201 of the Trade Act of 1974), those that address violations or denial of U.S. benefits under trade agreements (Section 301 of the Trade Act of 1974), and antidumping and countervailing duty laws (Title VII of the Tariff Act of 1930).

    "crs_R45472": "Human activities, particularly fossil fuel combustion and industrial operations, have raised the atmospheric concentration of carbon dioxide (CO2) and other greenhouse gases (GHG) by about 40% over the past 150 years. Almost all climate scientists agree that these GHG increases have contributed to a warmer climate today and that, if they continue, will contribute to future climate change. Although a range of actions that seek to reduce GHG emissions are currently underway or being developed on the international and sub-national level (e.g., individual state actions or regional partnerships), federal policymakers and stakeholders have different viewpoints over what to do, if anything, about future climate change and related impacts. Congressional interest in GHG emission control legislation has fluctuated over the last 15 years. Proposals to limit GHG emissions have often focused on market-based approaches, such as a GHG emission cap-and-trade program or a GHG emissions tax (often referred to as a carbon tax or fee) or fee. In general, a market-based approach would place a price on GHG emissions (e.g., through an emissions cap or emission tax or fee), allowing covered entities to determine their pathway of compliance. This report provides a comparison of the legislative proposals from the 108th through the 116th Congresses that were and are designed primarily to reduce GHG emissions using market-based approaches such as cap-and-trade or carbon tax/fee programs. During this time frame, Members introduced multiple energy-related proposals that would have likely resulted in reductions in GHG emissions\u2014legislation that promotes renewable energy or encourages carbon capture and sequestration\u2014but these bills are not discussed in this report. In addition, starting in the 112th Congress, some Members have introduced resolutions in the House and Senate expressing the view that a carbon tax is not in the economic interests of the United States. In September 2018, the House passed a resolution \"expressing the sense of Congress that a carbon tax would be detrimental to the United States economy\" (H.Con.Res. 119).

While the President nominates persons to fill federal judgeships, the appointment of each nominee also requires Senate confirmation. Historically, the vast majority of appointments to federal judgeships (other than to the Supreme Court) have typically not involved much public disagreement between the President and the Senate or between the parties within the Senate. Debate in the Senate over particular lower court nominees, or over the lower court appointment process itself, was uncommon. Typically, such nominations were both reported out of the Judiciary Committee and confirmed by the Senate without any recorded opposition. In recent decades, however, appointments to two kinds of lower federal courts\u2014the U.S. circuit courts of appeals and the U.S. district courts\u2014have often been the focus of heightened Senate interest and debate, as has the process itself for appointing judges to these courts. Given congressional interest in the subject, this report provides statistics and analysis related to the nomination and confirmation of U.S. circuit and district court judges from 1977 (the beginning of the Carter presidency) through 2018 (the second year of the Trump presidency).

Excluded from the scope of the report are the U.S. Supreme Court; the U.S. Court of International Trade; the U.S. Court of Federal Claims; and territorial district courts (e.g., the District Court of Guam). Various factors influence the number and percentage of judicial nominees confirmed during any given presidency or Congress. These factors include, but are not limited to, the frequency with which judges depart the bench; the speed with which a presidential Administration vets and selects nominees for vacant judgeships; whether a President is of the same political party as the majority party in the Senate; whether a congressional session coincides with a presidential election year; and the point in a congressional session when nominations arrive in the Senate.",
    "crs_R45685": "Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 (Title IX) provides an avenue of legal relief for victims of sexual abuse and harassment committed by professors, teachers, coaches, and others at educational institutions. The statute prohibits discrimination \"on the basis of sex\" of any person in an educational program or activity receiving federal funding. Though Title IX makes no explicit reference to sexual abuse or harassment, the Supreme Court has held that a school district can violate the statute, and be held liable for damages, based on a deliberately indifferent response to a teacher's sexual abuse or harassment of a student. The Court has also held that a school board may be liable under Title IX for a deliberately indifferent response to student-on-student sexual harassment. Meanwhile, federal agencies that administratively enforce the statute, such as the Department of Education (ED), have also determined that educational institutions can be held responsible for instances of sexual harassment under Title IX in certain circumstances. Title IX is thus primarily enforced in two ways: (1) through private rights of action directly against schools by or on behalf of students subject to such harassment in certain circumstances; and (2) by federal agencies that provide funding to educational programs. With respect to the latter enforcement prong, like several other federal civil rights statutes, Title IX makes compliance with its antidiscrimination mandate a condition for receiving federal funding in any education program or activity. Title IX applies to federal-funded schools at all levels of education. For instance, all public school districts receive some federal financial assistance, as do most institutions of higher education through participation in federal student aid programs. Notably, when any part of a school district or institution of higher education receives federal funds, all of the recipient's operations are covered by Title IX. The text of Title IX does not expressly mention sexual abuse or harassment, while current regulations implementing the statute also do not explicitly address sexual harassment (although the regulations do require schools to designate at least one employee to function as a Title IX Coordinator). In each of the last several presidential administrations, however, the Department of Education (ED) has issued guidance documents that instruct schools regarding their responsibilities under Title IX when addressing allegations of sexual harassment. In response, educational institutions have developed procedures and practices to investigate and respond to allegations of sexual harassment and assault. And ED recently issued another notice of proposed rule",

The phrase \"general and flag officers\" or \"GFO\" refers to all officers in paygrades O-7 through O-10, thereby including one-star, two-star, three-star, and four-star officers. At the highest level, O-10, GFOs hold the most visible and important military positions in the Department of Defense, including the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, the chiefs of the four military services, and the combatant commanders. At the lowest level, O-7, they hold positions that span an array of roles, including commanders, deputy commanders, and key staff roles in large organizations. This report provides an overview of active duty General and Flag Officers in the United States Armed Forces\u2014including authorizations, duties, and compensation\u2014historical trends in the proportion of GFOs relative to the total force, criticisms and justifications of GFO to total force proportions, and statutory controls. National Guard and Reserve GFOs are not addressed in this report, unless they are serving on active duty in a manner that counts against the active duty caps on GFOs. Given the authority granted to general and flag officers, Congress has developed a statutory framework applicable to this elite group, and considers changes to these laws as it deems appropriate. Congress also periodically reviews the number, duties, and compensation of GFOs. A frequent tension during these reviews has been DOD requests for additional GFOs versus congressional concerns that there are too many GFOs. As of November 1, 2018, there were 920 active duty GFOs, of which 891 were subject to the statutory caps and 29 were exempt from the statutory caps. The 891 GFOS subject to the statutory caps is lower than the maximum of 963 authorized in statute (see \"Current Grade Limits\"). This is in accord with an intentional decision made by DOD in 2011 as part of an efficiency initiative directed by then-Secretary of Defense Robert Gates. By keeping GFO numbers substantially below the maximum authorized, this policy provides DOD flexibility to respond to new requirements for GFOs without the delays caused by the need to find an \"offset\" by downgrading or eliminating another GFO position",
    "crs_R45615": "International trophy hunting is a multinational, multimillion-dollar industry practiced in countries on almost every continent. Trophy hunting is broadly defined as the killing of animals for recreation with the purpose of collecting trophies such as horns, antlers, skulls, skins, tusks, or teeth for display. International and domestic trophy hunting has a long history in the United States, and U.S. citizens import more wildlife trophies than citizens of any other country\u2014over 650,000 trophies in 2017 alone. Many of these trophies are deer, geese, and other common species that were hunted in neighboring countries, such as Canada. However, some of these trophies are rare and threatened animals hunted in countries throughout Africa and parts of Asia and South America. The practice of international trophy hunting, especially of rare and endangered species, has generated controversy for a number of reasons, including its relation to conservation (including of wildlife populations), ethical considerations, and its effect on local economies where the animals are hunted. Proponents of trophy hunting contend that the practice is a potential source of funding for the conservation of species in exchange for the hunting of a proportionally small number of individuals. Further, they argue that trophy hunting can create incentives for conserving habitat and ecosystems where hunted animals roam and, in some impoverished areas in range countries, can provide a means of income, employment, and community development. Critics of trophy hunting contend that the practice can lead to the decline of rare and endangered species and that the pathway of moving funds from hunting to conservation can be fraught with corruption and mismanagement. Further, some argue that it is unethical to kill animals for sport and that the life of an animal should not be valued according to how much a hunter would pay to kill it. Determining the effects of international trophy hunting on species\u2014with regard to either killing animals or conserving them through hunting revenue\u2014can be challenging for several reasons, namely due to lack of data, according to scientists. Difficulty gathering data from range countries can hinder attempts to develop an accurate sense of how hunting affects animals. For example, limited data may misrepresent the number of trophies harvested or animals killed, corruption can blur the route of money from hunters to conservation efforts, and a lack of information on conservation plans and practices associated with domestic laws",

One of the program's major benefits is that 8(a) firms can receive federal contracting preferences in the form of set-aside and sole-source awards. A set-aside award is a contract in which only certain contractors may compete, whereas a sole-source award is a contract awarded, or proposed for award, without competition. As a business development program, its overall goal is for 8(a) firms to graduate from the program and continue to do well in a competitive business environment. 8(a) Program eligibility is generally limited to small businesses which are \"unconditionally owned and controlled by one or more socially and economically disadvantaged individuals who are of good character and citizens of and residing in the United States\" and demonstrate \"potential for success.\" However, small businesses owned by Alaska Native Corporations (ANCs), Community Development Corporations (CDCs), Indian tribes, and Native Hawaiian Organizations (NHOs) are also eligible to participate in the 8(a) Program under somewhat different terms.

Congress enacted the Servicemembers Civil Relief Act (SCRA) in 2003 in response to the increased deployment of Reserve and National Guard military and as a modernization and restatement of the protections and rights previously available to servicemembers under the SSCRA. The SCRA has been amended since its initial passage, and Congress continues to consider amendments from time to time. Most recently, Congress has enacted amendments to extend certain benefits to the spouses of servicemembers. Congress has long recognized the need for protective legislation for servicemembers whose service to the nation compromises their ability to meet obligations and protect their legal interests. For example, Congress tolled all judicial actions during the Civil War, civil and criminal, for persons who \"by reason of resistance to the execution of the laws of the United States, or the interruption of the ordinary course of judicial proceedings,\" were beyond the reach of legal process. During World War I, Congress passed the Soldiers' and Sailors' Civil Relief Act of 1918, which, unlike many state laws of the Civil War era, did not create a moratorium on legal actions against servicemembers, but instead directed trial courts to apply principles of equity to determine the appropriate action to take whenever a servicemember's rights were implicated in a controversy. During World War II, Congress essentially reenacted the expired 1918 statute as the Soldiers' and Sailors' Civil Relief Act of 1940, and then amended it substantially in 1942 to take into account the new economic and legal landscape that had developed between the wars. Congress enacted amendments to the SSCRA on several occasions during subsequent conflicts, including in 2002, when the benefits of the SSCRA were extended to certain members of the National Guard.

The damages caused by the hurricanes are some of the worst in the history of the United States in terms of lives lost and property damaged and destroyed. The federal government played a significant role in the response to the hurricanes and Congress appropriated funds for a wide range of activities and efforts to help the Gulf Coast states recover and rebuild from the storms. In addition, Congress appropriated a significant amount of funds for mitigation activities and projects to reduce or eliminate the impacts of future storms. Though the storms happened over a decade ago, Congress remains interested in the types and amounts of federal assistance that were provided to the Gulf Coast for several reasons. For one, Congress continues to be interested in how the money has been spent, what resources have been provided to the region, and whether the money has reached the people and entities intended to receive the funds. The financial information is also useful for congressional oversight and evaluation of the federal entities that were responsible for response and recovery operations. Similarly, it gives Congress a general idea of the federal assets that are needed and can be brought to bear when catastrophic disasters take place in the United States. As such, the financial information from the storms can help frame the congressional debate concerning federal assistance for current and future disasters.

    "crs_R45557": "The North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) is an international trade agreement among the United States, Canada, and Mexico that became effective on January 1, 1994. The agreement includes market-opening provisions that remove tariff and nontariff barriers to trade, as well as other rules affecting trade in areas such as agriculture, customs procedures, foreign investment, government procurement, intellectual property protection, and trade in services. The United States approved NAFTA as a congressional-executive agreement by a majority vote of each house of Congress, rather than as a treaty ratified by the President after Senate approval by a two-thirds majority vote. It was not a self-executing agreement; rather, implementing legislation was required to provide domestic legal authorities with the power to enforce and comply with the agreement's provisions. Congress approved and implemented NAFTA in domestic law in the NAFTA Implementation Act. Although many U.S. obligations under NAFTA were already implemented in domestic law prior to Congress's enactment of the NAFTA Implementation Act, Congress delegated rulemaking authority to the President and various federal agencies in the Act so that they could further implement NAFTA in domestic law by promulgating executive orders, proclamations, or regulations. The NAFTA implementing legislation contemplates certain limited changes to certain provisions of NAFTA (e.g., certain rules of origin) in accordance with NAFTA's rules for minor amendments to the text of the agreement and limited congressional delegations of authority to the President to implement such changes in U.S. law. On May 18, 2017, U.S. Trade Representative (USTR) Ambassador Robert Lighthizer notified Congress that the Administration intended to renegotiate NAFTA. More than a year later, following the conclusion of the negotiations, President Trump signed a proposed replacement for NAFTA, the United States-Mexico-Canada Free Trade Agreement (USMCA), along with his counterparts from Canada and Mexico. President Trump has at times suggested that he will withdraw the United States from NAFTA unilaterally if Congress does not approve the USMCA.

Congress established this program in the Federal Water Pollution Control Act Amendments of 1972 (P.L. 92-500). The act authorized $18 billion over nine years for sewage treatment plant construction, through a combination of the Title II grants program and a new State Water Pollution Control Revolving Funds program\u2014hereinafter the clean water state revolving fund (CWSRF) program. Under the new program, in CWA Title VI, federal grants would be provided as seed money for state-administered loans to build sewage treatment plants and, eventually, other water quality projects. Cities, in turn, would repay loans to the state, enabling a phaseout of federal involvement while the state built up a source of capital for future investments. In 1996, Congress established a parallel program under the Safe Drinking Water Act (SDWA) to help communities finance projects needed to comply with federal drinking water regulations. Funding support for drinking water occurred for several reasons. First, until the 1980s, the number of drinking water regulations was fairly small, and public water systems often did not need to make large investments in treatment technologies to meet those regulations. Second, good quality drinking water traditionally has been available to many communities at relatively low cost. By comparison, essentially all communities have had to construct or upgrade sewage treatment facilities to meet the requirements of the CWA. Over time, drinking water circumstances changed, as communities grew, and commercial, industrial, agricultural, and residential land-uses became more concentrated, thus resulting in more contaminants reaching drinking water sources. Moreover, as the number of federal drinking water standards has increased, many communities have found that their water may not be as good as once thought and that additional treatment technologies are required to meet the new standards and protect public health. Between 1986 and 1996, for example, the number of regulated drinking water contaminants grew from 23 to 83, and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the states expressed concern that many of the nation's 52,000 small community water systems were likely to lack the financial capacity to meet the rising costs of SDWA compliance. Congress responded to these concerns by enacting the 1996 SDWA Amendments (P.L. 104-182), which authorized a drinking water state revolving loan fund (",

Participation in the program is temporary, with the goal of transitioning participants to unsubsidized employment. In FY2019, appropriations for the SCSEP program were $400 million and supported approximately 41,000 positions. SCSEP appropriations accounted for approximately 20% of total Older Americans Act funding in FY2019. SCSEP is authorized by Title V of the Older Americans Act of 1965, as amended (OAA; 42 U.S.C. 3056 et seq.) Since enactment of the OAA, Congress has reauthorized and amended the act numerous times. Most recently, the Older Americans Act Reauthorization Act of 2016 (P.L. 114-144) authorized appropriations for OAA programs for FY2017 through FY2019, and made other changes to the act. Prior to the 2016 OAA reauthorization, the OAA Amendments of 2006 (P.L. 109-365) reauthorized all programs under the act through FY2011. Although the authorizations of appropriations under the OAA expired at the end of FY2011, Congress continued to appropriate funding for OAA-authorized activities through FY2016. Grants under the program are administered by the Employment and Training Administration (ETA) at the Department of Labor (DOL).

The Trump Administration has continued the past commitment to provide assistance to Vietnam to address the Agent Orange/dioxin issue. Following a meeting with President Tran Dai Quang in May 2016, President Obama stated the following: With regard to security, the United States will continue to do our part to address the painful legacy of war.... We'll continue to help remove unexploded landmines and bombs. And now that our joint effort to remove dioxin\u2014Agent Orange\u2014from Danang Airport is nearly complete, the United States will help in the cleanup at Bien Hoa Air Base. The Trump Administration has continued the past commitment to provide assistance to Vietnam to address the Agent Orange/dioxin issue. Following their meeting in May 2017, President Trump and Prime Minister Nguyen Xuan Phuc released a joint statement, which stated: The two sides committed to work together to address war legacy issues, including through such joint efforts as dioxin remediation, taking note of the progress that has been made at Da Nang Airport and intent to discuss continued collaboration at Bien Hoa Airport, and the removal of unexploded ordnances.

In 1965, Congress reincarnated this joint committee to suggest additional changes in how the two chambers operate, and the committee was reconstituted during the 102nd and 103rd Congresses (1991-1994). While these efforts were bicameral in nature, other examinations of congressional operations, such as that being undertaken by this panel, have been focused primarily on the House. On January 4, 2019, the House established the Select Committee on the Modernization of Congress by adopting Title II of H.Res. 6, the House rules package for the 116th Congress (2019-2020), on a 418-12 vote. The stated purpose of the select committee is \"to investigate, study, make findings, hold public hearings, and develop recommendations on modernizing Congress.\" The select committee's authorization ends on February 1, 2020, and any activities beyond that date would require additional authorization.

Between 1946 and 2017, the United States provided the region with more than $88 billion ($181 billion in constant 2017 dollars) of assistance. U.S. assistance spiked in the early 1960s following the introduction of President John F. Kennedy's Alliance for Progress, an anti-poverty initiative that sought to counter Soviet and Cuban influence in the aftermath of Fidel Castro's 1959 seizure of power in Cuba. After a period of decline, U.S. assistance to the region increased again following the 1979 assumption of power by the leftist Sandinistas in Nicaragua. U.S. assistance to the region began to decline again in FY2011. Although the decline was partially the result of reductions in the overall U.S. foreign assistance budget in the aftermath of the U.S. recession, it also reflected changes in the region. Due to stronger economic growth and more effective social policies, the percentage of people living in poverty in Latin America fell from 45% in 2002 to 30% in 2017. Some nations, such as Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Mexico, and Uruguay, are now in a position to provide technical assistance to other countries in the region. Other nations, such as Bolivia and Ecuador, have expelled U.S. personnel and opposed U.S. assistance projects, leading to the closure of USAID offices. Collectively, these changes have resulted in the U.S. government concentrating foreign assistance resources in fewer countries and sectors. Aid levels have rebounded since FY2014, largely due to a renewed focus on Central America in response to recent migration trends, but appropriations remain below the FY2008-FY2013 average. The Trump Administration requested $1.1 billion for Latin America and the Caribbean through foreign assistance accounts managed by the State Department and the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) in FY2019. That amount would have been $581 million, or 34%, less than the estimated $1.7 billion of assistance Congress appropriated for the region in FY2018.

    "crs_R45500": "The nation's air, land, and marine transportation systems are designed for accessibility and efficiency, two characteristics that make them vulnerable to attack. The difficulty and cost of protecting the transportation sector from attack raises a core question for policymakers: how much effort and resources to put toward protecting potential targets versus pursuing and fighting terrorists. While hardening the transportation sector against terrorist attack is difficult, measures can be taken to deter terrorists. The focus of debate is how best to implement and finance a system of deterrence, protection, and response that effectively reduces the possibility and consequences of terrorist attacks without unduly interfering with travel, commerce, and civil liberties. For all modes of transportation, one can identify four principal policy objectives that would support a system of deterrence and protection: (1) ensuring the trustworthiness of the passengers and the cargo flowing through the system; (2) ensuring the trustworthiness of the transportation workers who operate and service the vehicles, assist the passengers, or handle the cargo; (3) ensuring the trustworthiness of the private companies that operate in the system, such as the carriers, shippers, agents, and brokers; and (4) establishing a perimeter of security around transportation facilities and vehicles in operation. The first three policy objectives are concerned with preventing an attack from within a transportation system, such as occurred on September 11, 2001. The concern is that attackers could once again disguise themselves as legitimate passengers (or shippers or workers) to get in position to launch an attack. The fourth policy objective is concerned with preventing an attack from outside a transportation system. For instance, terrorists could ram a bomb-laden speedboat into an oil tanker, as was done in October 2002 to the French oil tanker Limberg, or they could shoot a shoulder-fired missile at an airplane taking off or landing, as was attempted in November 2002 against an Israeli charter jet in Mombasa, Kenya. Achieving all four of these objectives is difficult at best, and in some modes is practically impossible. Where limited options exist for preventing an attack, policymakers are left with evaluating options for minimizing the consequences of an attack, without unduly interfering with travel, commerce, and civil liberties. The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) has been a focal point for aviation security since the 9/11 terrorist attacks. It has initiated a number of risk-based passenger",

Most Members of Congress support a robust use of sanctions amid concerns about Russia's international behavior and geostrategic intentions.

When Morsi took office on June 30, 2012, after winning Egypt's first truly competitive presidential election, his ascension to the presidency was supposed to mark the end of a rocky 16-month transition period. Proposed time lines for elections, the constitutional drafting process, and the military's relinquishing of power to a civilian government had been constantly changed, contested, and sometimes even overruled by the courts. Instead of consolidating democratic or civilian rule, Morsi's rule exposed the deep divisions in Egyptian politics, pitting a broad cross-section of Egypt's public and private sectors, the Coptic Church, and the military against the Muslim Brotherhood and its Islamist supporters. The atmosphere of mutual distrust, political gridlock, and public dissatisfaction that permeated Morsi's presidency provided Egypt's military, led by then-Defense Minister Abdel Fattah al Sisi, with an opportunity to reassert political control. On July 3, 2013, following several days of mass demonstrations against Morsi's rule, the military unilaterally dissolved Morsi's government, suspended the constitution that had been passed during his rule, and installed an interim president. The Muslim Brotherhood and its supporters declared the military's actions a coup d'etat and protested in the streets. Weeks later, Egypt's military and national police launched a violent crackdown against the Muslim Brotherhood, resulting in police and army soldiers firing live ammunition against demonstrators en",

Individuals sometimes request relief through private law when administrative or legal remedies are exhausted, but Congress seems more often to view private legislation as appropriate when no other remedy is available and when enactment would, in a broad sense, afford equity. From 1817 through 1971, most Congresses enacted hundreds of private laws, but since then the number has declined significantly as Congress has expanded administrative discretion to deal with many of the situations that tended to give rise to private bills. Since 2007, four private laws have been enacted. Private provisions are also occasionally included in public legislation.

    "crs_R41705": "The National Institutes of Health (NIH) is the primary agency of the federal government charged with performing and supporting biomedical and behavioral research. It has major roles in training biomedical researchers and disseminating health information. The NIH mission is \"to seek fundamental knowledge about the nature and behavior of living systems and the application of that knowledge to enhance health, lengthen life, and reduce illness and disability.\" As of FY2018, NIH was the largest single public funder of biomedical research in the world. Congress maintains a high level of interest in NIH for a variety of reasons. NIH funds extramural researchers in every state, and widespread constituencies contact Congress about funding for particular diseases and levels of research support in general. NIH is the largest and most visible contributor to the federal biomedical research effort; it represents about half of federal spending for non-Department of Defense research and development (R&D) and about one-fifth of total federal R&D funding. It has the largest budget of the eight health-related agencies that make up the Public Health Service (PHS) within the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). In FY2018, discretionary appropriations to NIH constituted about 40% of all HHS discretionary budget authority. NIH-funded research has led to major medical innovations, such as treatments for heart disease, cancer, and HIV/AIDs. However, in light of the high cost of new medical innovations, some question whether NIH priorities are too focused on research that leads to new treatments rather than on disease prevention or improving the value of medical care. The allocation of NIH research dollars is a major source of debate. NIH has seen periods of both low and high funding growth. From FY1998 to FY2003, Congress doubled the NIH budget over a five-year period, from $13.7 billion to $27.1 billion. The agency then saw low funding growth or cuts from FY2004 to FY2015. From FY2016 through FY2019, Congress provided NIH with funding increases of over 5% each year, increasing funding from $30.3 billion in FY2015 to $39.3 billion in FY2019.

The federal government, though, seeks to influence states' juvenile justice systems through the administration of grant programs and the provision of funds. This report provides a brief overview of funding for the juvenile justice-related grant programs administered by the Department of Justice's (DOJ's) Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention (OJJDP). The JJDPA as originally enacted had three main components: (1) it established OJJDP to coordinate and administer federal juvenile justice efforts; (2) it created grant programs to assist states with their juvenile justice systems; and (3) it promulgated core mandates to which states must adhere in order to be eligible for certain grant funding. Although the JJDPA has been amended several times over the past 40 years, it continues to feature these three components. The JJDPA has been the primary channel through which the federal government has provided juvenile justice funding to states. However, other programs also administered by OJJDP have contributed to overall federal juvenile justice funding. The Juvenile Justice Reform Act of 2018 (P.L. 115-385) amended and reauthorized the JJDPA and the Juvenile Accountability Block Grant (JABG) program through FY2023.

    "crs_R45688": "Timber harvesting on federal lands is a long-standing activity which sometimes generates controversy. Most timber harvesting on federal lands occurs on lands directed to provide a regular output of multiple uses under current law. Determining the proportions of these uses, in whole and on individual lands, is challenging for land management agencies. Often at issue is the appropriate use of federal lands for timber harvesting under these policies, including what amount of timber harvesting should occur and what constitutes proper balance among timber harvesting and other uses. Congress has authorized timber harvesting on certain federal lands under specified circumstances. Most timber harvesting on federal lands occurs on two land systems. The majority of harvests occur on the National Forest System (NFS), which is managed by the Forest Service (FS) within the Department of Agriculture (USDA). Harvests also occur on the public lands managed by the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) within the Department of the Interior (DOI). The FS manages 144.9 million acres of forest, while the BLM manages 37.6 million acres of forest. Together, FS and BLM forest comprises 76% of federal forest area and 23% of all forest in the United States. Within their respective forest, the FS has 96.1 million acres of timberlands, and the BLM has 6.1 million acres of timberlands. The United States has 765.5 million acres of forest, of which 514.4 million acres is timberland and 57% is private. The United States has 57.0 million acres of woodland. Timber harvesting is one of many authorized uses of the National Forest System. The amount of timber harvested from the NFS, and its relative proportion of total U.S. timber supply, has fluctuated over time. The volume of timber harvested from the NFS increased slowly from 1898 until the 1940s. Most demand for wood was met by private timberlands; by 1940, for example, FS lands supplied 2% of U.S. timber supply. In the post-World War II era, timber harvest volume from the NFS grew. The timber supply from private forestry was unable to keep pace with the increased demand, due in part to high harvest levels during WWII. In the 1950s, the FS began to raise harvest limits. Harvests rose from 1-3 billion board feet (abbreviated BBF) annually in the early 1940s to more than",

Obligated parties, such as refiners or importers of gasoline or diesel fuel, are responsible for complying with the RFS requirements. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) administers the mandate, which is an amendment to Clean Air Act (CAA) provisions governing the regulation of fuels. The statutory renewable fuel volume increases annually until 2022, with EPA determining the volume after 2022 within certain limitations. In general, EPA has the authority to waive the RFS requirements, in whole or in part, if certain conditions outlined in statute prevail. The RFS is a complex and highly technical policy initiative. It deals with multiple sectors of the economy and requires the use of some advanced renewable fuel production technologies that have yet to reach maturity. The RFS also incorporates thresholds for greenhouse gas emission reduction. This complexity is exacerbated by multiple stakeholders with differing perspectives on what the RFS should accomplish, how it should be implemented, and whether it should exist, which leads to debate about the RFS and its future. Congressional debate about the RFS is expected to continue with special attention to how EPA administers the program. As Congress continues its oversight of the RFS, it may be useful to understand the RFS waiver authority granted to EPA. This report discusses the waiver provisions of the RFS, including the modification-of-applicable-volumes (\"reset\") section. The RFS provisions of the CAA contain a set of waiver provisions. The provisions contain three separate waiver provisions\u2014a general waiver, a cellulosic biofuel waiver, and a biomass-based diesel waiver\u2014that the EPA Administrator may use to waive, in whole or in part, the volume of renewable fuel mandated by statute.

Government programs to improve health, agricultural output, private investment, and gender equality have received international plaudits and donor support. The ruling Rwandan Patriotic Front (RPF) seized power in mid-1994, stopping the genocide. Since then, President Paul Kagame has been widely viewed as the architect of Rwanda's development \"miracle\" and of its autocratic political model. He has repeatedly won reelection by wide margins, most recently in 2017 (see \"Polices\"). The United States and Rwanda have cultivated close ties since the mid-1990s, underpinned by U.S. aid in support of Rwanda's ambitious socioeconomic development initiatives and participation in international peacekeeping. Over the past decade, U.S. officials and some Members of Congress have continued to promote U.S.-Rwanda partnership on shared objectives, while voicing concerns regarding Rwanda's authoritarian political system and its periodic support for rebel groups in neighboring countries. Congress has held multiple hearings examining these and related issues, and has enacted restrictions on aid to Rwanda if it is found to be supporting rebel groups. In late 2017, then Acting Assistant Secretary of State for Africa Donald Yamamoto testified to Congress that U.S.-Rwandan relations were \"close but complex,\" acknowledging democracy shortfalls and human rights concerns. President Trump met with President Kagame at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, in January 2018, and expressed appreciation for bilateral economic ties, Rwanda's contributions to peacekeeping operations, and Kagame's pursuit of African Union (AU) institutional reforms as then-chairman of the institution.

At the same time, internet connectivity has increased and varied in form in recent years, expanding from personal computers and mobile phones to everyday objects such as home appliances, \"smart\" speakers, vehicles, and other internet-connected devices. Americans now transmit their personal data on the internet at an exponentially higher rate than the past. Along with the increased connectivity, a growing number of \"consumer facing\" actors (such as websites) and \"behind the scenes\" actors (such as data brokers and advertising companies) collect, maintain, and use consumers' information. While this data collection can benefit consumers\u2014for instance, by allowing companies to offer them more tailored products\u2014it also raises privacy concerns, as consumers often cannot control how these entities use their data. As a consequence, the protection of personal data has emerged as a major issue for congressional consideration. Despite the increased interest in data protection, the legal paradigms governing the security and privacy of personal data are complex and technical, and lack uniformity at the federal level. The Supreme Court has recognized that the Constitution provides various rights protecting individual privacy, but these rights generally guard only against government intrusions and do little to prevent private actors from abusing personal data online. At the federal statutory level, while there are a number of data protection statutes, they primarily regulate certain industries and subcategories of data. The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) fills in some of the statutory gaps by enforcing the federal prohibition against unfair and deceptive data protection practices. But no single federal law comprehensively regulates the collection and use of personal data. In contrast to the \"patchwork\" nature of federal law, some state and foreign governments have enacted more comprehensive data protection legislation. Some analysts suggest these laws, which include the European Union's (EU's) General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and state laws such as the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA), will create increasingly overlapping and uneven data protection regimes. This fragmented legal landscape coupled with concerns that existing federal laws are inadequate has led many stakeholders to argue that the federal government should assume a larger role in data protection policy.

In FY2018, U.S. agricultural exports to Canada and Mexico tetaled $143 billion, of which Canada and Mexico jointly accounted for about 27%. USDA's Economic Research Service estimates that in 2017 each dollar of U.S. agricultural exports stimulated an additional $1.30 in business activity in the United States. That same year, U.S. agricultural exports generated an estimated 1,161,000 full-time civilian jobs, including 795,000 jobs outside the farm sector. U.S. agricultural exports to Canada and Mexico are an important part of the U.S. economy, and the growth of these markets is partly the result of the North American market liberalization under the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). On September 30, 2018, the Trump Administration announced an agreement with Canada and Mexico for a U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) that would possibly replace NAFTA. NAFTA entered into force on January 1, 1994, following the passage of the implementing legislation by Congress (P.L. 103-182). The agricultural provisions agreed upon for CUSTA remained in force as provisions of the new NAFTA agreement. While tariffs were phased out for almost all agricultural products, NAFTA (in accordance with the original CUSTA provisions) exempted certain products from market liberalization. These exemptions included U.S. imports from Canada of dairy products, peanuts, peanut butter, cotton, sugar, and sugar-containing products and Canadian imports from the United States of dairy products, poultry, eggs, and margarine. Canada liberalized its agricultural sector under NAFTA, but liberalization did not include its dairy, poultry, and egg product sectors, which continued to be governed by domestic supply management policies and are protected from imports by high over-quota tariffs.

The increased number of Central Americans petitioning for asylum in the United States is not because more people are \"exploiting\" the system via \"loopholes,\" but because many have credible claims.... There is no recorded evidence by any U.S. federal agency showing that the increased number of people petitioning for asylum in the United States is due to more people lying about the dangers they face back in their country of origin. Several key policy considerations about asylum are highlighted below. Some, such as the grounds for granting asylum, have been long-standing issues for policymakers, while others, such as safe third country agreements, have been garnering attention more recently. The INA defines a refugee, in general, as a person who is outside his or her country of nationality and is unable or unwilling to return to, or to avail himself or herself of the protection of, that country because of persecution or a well-founded fear of persecution based on one of five protected grounds: race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion.

Among other relevant grants, Congress has the power to declare war and raise and support the armed forces (Article I, Section 8), while the President is Commander in Chief (Article II, Section 2). It is generally agreed that the Commander-in-Chief role gives the President power to utilize the armed forces to repel attacks against the United States, but there has long been controversy over whether he is constitutionally authorized to send forces into hostile situations abroad without a declaration of war or other congressional authorization. Congressional concern about presidential use of armed forces without congressional authorization intensified after the Korean conflict. During the Vietnam War, Congress searched for a way to assert authority to decide when the United States should become involved in a war or the armed forces be utilized in circumstances that might lead to hostilities. On November 7, 1973, it passed the War Powers Resolution (P.L. 93-148) over the veto of President Nixon. The main purpose of the Resolution was to establish procedures for both branches to share in decisions that might get the United States involved in war. The drafters sought to circumscribe the President's authority to use armed forces abroad in hostilities or potential hostilities without a declaration of war or other congressional authorization, yet provide enough flexibility to permit him to respond to attack or other emergencies. The record of the War Powers Resolution since its enactment has been mixed, and after 40 years it remains controversial. Some Members of Congress believe the Resolution has on some occasions served as a restraint on the use of armed forces by Presidents, provided a mode of communication, and given Congress a vehicle for asserting its war powers. Others have sought to amend the Resolution because they believe it has failed to assure a congressional voice in committing U.S. troops to potential conflicts abroad. Others in Congress, along with executive branch officials, contend that the President needs more flexibility in the conduct of foreign policy and that the time limitation in the War Powers Resolution is unconstitutional and impractical.

The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) will implement the provisions, most of which take effect in calendar year 2019. The 2018 farm bill includes 12 titles covering different program areas. The first title, Title I\u2014Commodities, authorizes several major revenue support and disaster assistance programs. The second title, Title II\u2014Sugar and dairy, authorizes separate federal farm programs that are tailored more specifically to the physical differences associated with each of their products\u2014refined sugar and liquid fresh milk\u2014and their respective markets. Disaster assistance is available for producers of most tree crops and livestock. The Noninsured Crop Assistance Program is available for all agricultural commodities that are not covered by a federal crop insurance policy. All of these Title I programs existed under the previous 2014 farm bill. The 2018 farm bill extends their authority through crop year 2023 but with some modifications to most of them. Occasionally, agricultural producers may receive federal support under programs authorized outside of the farm bill. The Secretary of Agriculture has broad latitude under the authority of the Commodity Credit Corporation (CCC) Charter Act to make direct payments in support of U.S. agriculture. Two such programs implemented in recent years under CCC authority are the Cotton Ginning Cost Share program and the Market Facilitation Program. Separately, under the federal crop insurance program, Title I program commodities\u2014along with more than 100 other crops including fruits and vegetables\u2014are also eligible for subsidized crop insurance, which provides within-year yield (or revenue) protection. The federal crop insurance program is permanently authorized outside of the omnibus farm bill by the Federal Crop Insurance Act (7 U.S.C. 1501 et seq.). The 2018 farm bill includes Title XI\u2014Crop Insurance, which makes minor adjustments to program implementation but does not alter the underlying authority of the federal crop insurance program. The 2018 farm bill includes the most recent version of the farm commodity support programs. It supersedes the commodity provisions of previous farm bills and includes a provision (Section 1702) that suspends the relevant price support provisions of permanent law for the crop (and marketing) years 2019-2023.

Different House rules establish availability requirements for reported bills and resolutions, unreported bills and joint resolutions, conference committee reports, and special rules (resolutions reported by the Rules Committee intended to regulate floor consideration of a measure named in the resolution). Under House rules, draft committee reports and unreported bills and joint resolutions are considered available under these rules if they are \"publicly available in electronic form at a location designated by the Committee on House Administration.\" Conference committee reports and accompanying joint explanatory statements are also considered available if they are in electronic form at such a location. It is not a requirement under the rule that the measures be available in the designated location. Instead, the House rule is meant to provide an additional means through which Members, congressional staff, and the general public can access these documents. The House frequently operates under special rules, or resolutions reported by the Rules Committee, which can waive any or all of the above rules. Special rules are required to lie over for one legislative day, which means the special rule cannot be reported and considered on the same legislative day.

    "crs_RS22954": "Unemployment Compensation (UC) is a joint federal-state program financed by federal payroll taxes under the Federal Unemployment Tax Act (FUTA) and by state payroll taxes under State Unemployment Tax Acts (SUTA). These revenues are deposited into the appropriate account within the federal Unemployment Trust Fund (UTF). Originally, the intent of the UC program, among other goals, was to help counter economic fluctuations such as recessions. This intent is reflected in the current UC program's funding and benefit structure. When the economy grows, UC program revenue rises through increased tax revenues. At the same time, UC program spending falls because fewer workers are unemployed. The effect of collecting more taxes while decreasing spending on benefits dampens demand in the economy. It also creates a surplus of funds, or a reserve fund, for the UC program to draw upon during a recession. These reserve balances are credited in the state's account within the UTF. During an economic slowdown or recession, UC tax revenue falls and UC program spending rises as more workers lose their jobs and receive UC benefits. The increased amount of UC payments to unemployed workers dampens the economic effect of lost earnings by injecting additional funds into the economy. The U.S. Department of Labor (DOL) is required by federal law to refuse to certify that state's program as being in compliance with federal law. Not being in compliance with federal law would mean that the state would not be eligible to receive administrative grants and employers in that state would not receive the state unemployment tax credit in the calculation of their federal unemployment taxes.

During 2014, the United States joined Saudi Arabia in demanding that Houthi forces reverse their campaign to occupy the Yemeni capital of Sanaa, but the rapid onset of hostilities in March 2015 forced the Obama Administration to react quickly. At the start of the Saudi-led intervention on March 25, 2015, the Administration announced that the United States would provide \"logistical and intelligence support\" to the coalition's operations without taking \"direct military action in Yemen in support of this effort.\" Soon thereafter, a joint U.S.-Saudi planning cell was established to coordinate military and intelligence support for the campaign. At the United Nations Security Council, the United States supported the passage of Resolution 2216 (April 2015), which, among other things, required member states to impose an arms embargo against the Houthi-Saleh forces and demanded that the Houthi withdraw from all areas seized during the current conflict. Since the March 2015 Saudi-led coalition intervention in Yemen, Congress has taken an active role in debating and overseeing U.S. policy in the Arabian Peninsula. Members have considered legislative proposals seeking to reduce Yemeni civilian casualties resulting from the coalition's operations; improve deteriorating humanitarian conditions; end restrictions on the flow of goods and humanitarian aid; combat Iranian support for the Houthi; preserve maritime security in the Bab al Mandab Strait; and/or support continued Saudi-led coalition and U.S. efforts to counter Al Qaeda and Islamic State forces in Yemen. Beyond Yemen, many Members have appeared to view the conflict through the prism of a broader regional rivalry between Saudi Arabia and Iran, and the U.S. effort to limit Iran's malign regional influence. Others lawmakers have viewed the Yemen conflict as indicative of what they perceive as problems in the U.S.-Saudi relationship, a concern that deepened after the killing of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi by Saudi government personnel in October 2018.

It replaced the program of cash assistance for needy families that dated back to the New Deal, Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC), and some of its related programs. The enactment of the 1996 welfare reform law was the culmination of a debate about how to overhaul programs providing cash assistance to needy families with children\u2014specifically, those headed by single mothers\u2014that spanned four decades: from the 1960s to the 1990s. The 1996 welfare law provided both program authority and funding (appropriations) for TANF through the end of FY2002. Most of the legislative activity on TANF since 2002 has been to extend the program funding and financing authority for TANF. Most of these extensions did not change TANF policy, though policy changes were included in extensions enacted in 2006, 2010, and 2012. The TANF Extension Act of 2019 (P.L. 116-4) extended TANF funding through June 30, 2019.

    "crs_RS20530": "The Federal Housing Administration (FHA) is an agency of the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) that insures private mortgage lenders against the possibility of borrowers defaulting on certain mortgage loans. If a mortgage borrower defaults on a mortgage\u2014that is, does not repay the mortgage as promised\u2014and the home goes to foreclosure, FHA is to pay the lender the remaining amount that the borrower owes. FHA insurance protects the lender, rather than the borrower, in the event of borrower default; a borrower who defaults on an FHA-ind mortgage will still experience the consequences of foreclosure. To be eligible for FHA insurance, the mortgage must be originated by a lender that has been approved by FHA, and the mortgage and the borrower must meet certain criteria. FHA is one of three government agencies that provide insurance or guarantees on certain home mortgages made by private lenders, along with the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) and the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA). Of these federal mortgage insurance programs, FHA is the most broadly targeted. Unlike VA- and USDA-insured mortgages, the availability of FHA-ind mortgages is not limited by factors such as veteran status, income, or whether the property is located in a rural area. However, the availability or attractiveness of FHA-ind mortgages may be limited by other factors, such as the maximum mortgage amount that FHA will insure, the fees that it charges for insurance, and its eligibility standards. This report provides background on FHA's history and market role and an overview of the basic eligibility and underwriting criteria for FHA-insured home loans. It also provides data on the number and dollar volume of mortgages that FHA insures, along with data on FHA's market share in recent years.

    "crs_R40864": "The issue of the President and Vice President's term of office is generally regarded as an accepted constitutional norm that arouses little controversy in the 21st century. Both the four-year term and the venerable two-term tradition, initiated by George Washington and ultimately incorporated in the Constitution in 1951 by the Twenty-Second Amendment, appear to be fixed elements in the nation's political landscape. In marked comparison, the issues of tenure and reelection of the President, and of the Vice President (an office added almost as an afterthought during the Constitutional Convention of 1787), were the subject of intense and prolonged debate during the Philadelphia gathering. Delegates argued for three months over the length of the presidential term and whether the chief executive should be eligible for reelection before reaching a compromise package of provisions\u2014a four-year term, and eligibility for reelection\u2014several days before the convention adjourned. Since that time, a wide range of changes to these conditions has been proposed as constitutional amendments, but relatively few conditions have been added to the original provisions governing the President's term of office. In addition to the Twenty-Second Amendment cited above, the Twelfth, ratified in 1804, set the same qualifications for the Vice President; the Twentieth, ratified in 1933, set January 20 of every year following a presidential election as the date on which the chief executive's term begins; and the Twenty-Fifth Amendment clarified the question of vice-presidential succession to the presidency and authorized the President to nominate persons to fill vacancies in the vice presidency, subject to approval by vote of both houses of Congress. Proposals for a single term were popular in the 19th century, and for several decades before the Civil War, the concept of a voluntary limit of one presidential term in office drew wide support. Beginning in 1808, constitutional amendments were introduced that would have changed the presidential term to five, six, seven, or eight-year terms. By the 20th century, a six-year single term of office had become the preferred alternative.

Members may introduce legislation for any number of reasons, and they may do so on behalf of another individual, entity, or group \"by request.\" Between 1973 and 2018, Members introduced an average of about 20 bills and resolutions each per Congress. Statistics on introduced measures are presented in Table 1. When a Representative has determined that a bill or resolution is ready for introduction, it is placed in the box, or \"hopper,\" at the bill clerk's desk on the chamber floor when the House is in session, including a \"pro forma\" session. The sponsor must sign the measure and attach the names of any original cosponsors on a form provided by the Clerk's office, which is located in Room H-154 of the Capitol Building (5-7000). Cosponsors do not sign the bill. Under the Speaker's announced policies of the 116th Congress (2019-2020), sponsors are \"encouraged\" to obtain original signatures from cosponsors prior to submitting a cosponsorship form. The bill as drafted by legislative counsel leaves space both for the insertion of a bill number, which is assigned chronologically based on the date of introduction, and for the Parliamentarian's office to note the committee(s) to which the measure was referred. A Member need not seek recognition from the chamber's presiding officer in order to introduce a measure. Following introduction, Members often summarize the purpose and merits of their proposal in a statement published in the \"Extension of Remarks\" section of the Congressional Record. Since the 112th Congress, House rules have required Members to provide at the time of introduction a statement of constitutional authority indicating why Congress has the authority to enact the proposed bill or joint resolution.

The United States has not used conscription to fill manpower requirements for over four decades; however, the Selective Service System and the requirement for young men to register for the draft remain today. Men who fail to register are subject to penalties in the form of lost benefits and criminal action. Some have questioned the need to maintain this agency and the registration requirements. Others have questioned whether the current requirements for registration are fair and equitable. This report is intended to provide Congress with information about how the Military Selective Service Act (MSSA), the Selective Service System (SSS), and associated requirements for registration have evolved over time. It explains why the United States developed the SSS, what the system looks like today, how constituents are affected by the MSSA requirements, and what the options and considerations may be for the future of the Selective Service. The first section of the report provides background and history on the Military Selective Service Act, the Selective Service System, and the implementation of the draft in the United States. The second section discusses statutory registration requirements, processes for registering, and penalties for failing to register. The third section discusses the current organization, roles, and resourcing of the Selective Service System. The final section discusses policy options and considerations for Congress for the future of the Selective Service. This report does not discuss the state of the all-volunteer force or whether it is adequate to meet our nation's current or future manpower needs. In addition, it will not provide an analysis of other options for military manpower resourcing such as universal military service or universal military training.

    "crs_R43568": "The U.S. corporate income tax is based on worldwide economic activity. If all of a corporation's economic activity is in the United States, then tax administration and compliance is relatively straightforward. Many corporations, however, operate in several jurisdictions, which creates complications for tax administration and compliance. Further, corporations may actively choose where and how to organize to reduce their U.S. and worldwide tax liabilities. Some of these strategies have been referred to as expatriation, inversions, and mergers. A corporate inversion is a process by which an existing U.S. corporation changes its country of residence. After the inversion, the original U.S. corporation becomes a subsidiary of a foreign parent corporation. Corporate inversions occur through three different paths: the substantial activity test, merger with a larger foreign firm, and merger with a smaller foreign firm. Regardless of the form of the inversion, the typical result is that the new foreign parent company faces a lower home country tax rate and no tax on the company's foreign-source income. The U.S. firm can use inversions to reduce taxes using various techniques. Foreign operations in the future can be formed as subsidiaries of the new foreign parent in a country with a territorial tax, so that future foreign income can be exempt from tax. Accumulated and future foreign income from the U.S. company's foreign subsidiaries (which would be taxed by the United States if paid to the parent as a dividend) may be effectively repatriated tax free by lending or otherwise investing in the related foreign firm, such as a low-interest loan to the foreign parent holding company. These borrowed funds could then be used, for example, to pay dividends to shareholders or make loans to the U.S. firm. In addition, the combined firm can engage in \"earnings stripping,\" reducing income in the U.S. firm by borrowing from the U.S. company and increasing interest deductions.

Its name is derived from Section 7(a) of the Small Business Act of 1953 (P.L. 83-163, as amended), which authorizes the SBA to provide and guarantee business loans to American small businesses. The SBA also administers several 7(a) subprograms that offer streamlined and expedited loan procedures for particular groups of borrowers, including the SBAExpress, Export Express, and Community Advantage Pilot programs. Although these subprograms have their own distinguishing eligibility requirements, terms, and benefits, they operate under the 7(a) program's authorization. Proceeds from 7(a) loans may be used to establish a new business or to assist in the operation, acquisition, or expansion of an existing business. Specific uses include to acquire land (by purchase or lease); improve a site (e.g., grading, streets, parking lots, and landscaping); purchase, convert, expand, or renovate one or more existing buildings; construct one or more new buildings; acquire (by purchase or lease) and install fixed assets; purchase inventory, supplies, and raw materials; finance working capital; and refinance certain outstanding debts.

The act authorizes the President to declare, by public proclamation, historic landmarks, historic and prehistoric structures, and other objects of historic or scientific interest located on federal land as national monuments. It also authorizes the President to reserve parcels of land surrounding these objects, but limits the size of such reservations to \"the smallest area compatible with the proper care and management of the objects to be protected.\" Though the Antiquities Act was enacted with the primary goal of preserving archaeological sites, it has also been frequently used to protect naturally occurring objects, such as the geological features within the Grand Canyon National Monument. Once a national monument is established, use of the lands and resources within the monument's boundaries are subject to the limitations specified in the proclamation itself and other sources of law, without need of congressional authorization. Since its enactment, Presidents have used the Antiquities Act to establish 158 national monuments, reserving millions of acres of land in the process, and to modify existing monuments more than 90 times. Like many laws concerning federal lands, the Antiquities Act operates in the midst of an ongoing, and sometimes contentious, public policy debate regarding how to best reconcile the need to preserve natural resources and other objects located on public lands with the needs of the local communities affected by the limitations on land use that follow from the creation of a national monument. Though most monument proclamations have been uncontroversial, some have precipitated corrective legislation and litigation. In two instances, Congress passed legislation placing geographic limits on the President's authority to establish national monuments. Attempts to undo proclamations through litigation have been less successful, as courts have uniformly upheld challenged proclamations through a broad interpretation of the Antiquities Act. The Antiquities Act has received renewed attention in recent years as a result of President Trump's December 2017 proclamations reducing the size of the Grand Staircase-Escalante National Monument and the Bears Ears National Monument.

U.S. and Russian officials had met in Geneva on January 15, 2019, in one last attempt to reach an agreement. According to press reports, Russian diplomats proposed that Russia display the 9M729 missile and demonstrate that it could not fly to INF range, while the United States, in exchange, could demonstrate that the MK-41 launchers in Romania could not be converted to launch INF-range cruise missiles. The United States rejected this proposal and indicated that the only acceptable solution would be for Russia to destroy the missile, its launchers, and its supporting infrastructure. Nevertheless, on January 23, 2019, Russia displayed the canister for the 9M729 cruise missile for an audience of foreign military attach\u00e9s and the press. Russia noted that, although the missile was a little longer than the similar 9M728 cruise missile, the added length did not increase the range of the missile. It was needed to house a larger warhead and guidance system. No officials from the United States or NATO nations attended the display, arguing that it was a public relations event. U.S. officials also argued that a static display of the missile's canister would not address questions about the missile's range in flight. Over the past few years, NATO, as a whole, has echoed U.S. concerns about Russia's new missile, but some Members have expressed doubt about whether the United States had enough evidence to conclude that the missile violated the INF Treaty. This doubt has ebbed recently, as the allies have offered strong support for the U.S. decision to withdraw from the treaty. In a joint statement released after their December 4 meeting, NATO Foreign Ministers stated that they \"strongly support the finding... that Russia is in material breach of its obligations under the INF Treaty.\" In a statement released on February 1, 2019, the North Atlantic Council noted that Russia had \"taken no demonstrable steps toward returning to full and verifiable compliance\" and that \"Russia will bear sole responsibility for the",
    "crs_R45546": "The Colorado River Basin covers more than 246,000 square miles. The river runs through seven U.S. states (Wyoming, Colorado, Utah, New Mexico, Arizona, Nevada, and California) and Mexico. Pursuant to federal law, the Bureau of Reclamation (Reclamation, part of the Department of the Interior [DOI]) plays a prominent role in the management of the basin's waters. In the Lower Basin (i.e., Arizona, Nevada, and California), Reclamation also serves as water master on behalf of the Secretary of the Interior, a role that elevates the status of the federal government in basin water management. The federal role in the management of Colorado River water is magnified by the multiple federally owned and operated water storage and conveyance facilities in the basin, which provide low-cost water and hydropower supplies to water users. Colorado River water is used primarily for agricultural irrigation and municipal and industrial (M&I) purposes. The river's flow and stored water also are important for power production, fish and wildlife, and recreation, among other uses. A majority (70%) of basin water supplies are used to irrigate 5.5 million acres of land; basin waters also provide M&I water supplies to nearly 40 million people. Much of the area that depends on the river for water supplies is outside of the drainage area for the Colorado River Basin. Storage and conveyance facilities on the Colorado River provide trans-basin diversions that serve areas such as Cheyenne, WY; multiple cities in Colorado's Front Range (e.g., Fort Collins, Denver, Boulder, and Colorado Springs, CO); Provo, UT; Albuquerque and Santa Fe, NM; and Los Angeles, San Diego, and the Imperial Valley in Southern California.

    "crs_R43997": "The four major federal land management agencies maintain tens of thousands of diverse assets in dispersed locations. These agencies are the Bureau of Land Management (BLM), Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS), and National Park Service (NPS), all within the Department of the Interior (DOI), and the Forest Service (FS) within the Department of Agriculture. These agencies maintain assets to preserve their functioning and to repair and replace components as needed. The infrastructure needs of the federal land management agencies have been a subject of significant federal and public attention for many years. Congressional and administrative attention has focused on deferred maintenance and repairs, defined as \"maintenance and repairs that were not performed when they should have been or were scheduled to be and which are put off or delayed for a future period.\" Deferred maintenance and repairs often are called the maintenance backlog. The agencies assert that continuing to defer the maintenance and repair of facilities accelerates the rate of these facilities' deterioration, increases their repair costs, and decreases their value. Debate has focused on varied issues, including the level of funds needed to reduce deferred maintenance, whether agencies are using existing funding efficiently, the priority of deferred maintenance relative to regular maintenance, and whether additional sources of funds should be directed to maintenance. Other issues include how to balance the maintenance of existing infrastructure with the acquisition of new assets, whether disposal of assets is desirable given limited funding, and how much to prioritize maintaining infrastructure relative to other government functions. Another issue relates to the dollar amount of deferred maintenance and the reasons for fluctuations over time. This report focuses on these issues. It first provides agency deferred maintenance estimates for FY2018, the most recent fiscal year for which this information is available. It also discusses changes in deferred maintenance over the past decade (FY2009-FY2018) and then identifies some of the factors that likely contributed to these changes. The four agencies had combined FY2018 deferred maintenance estimated at $19.38 billion. The agencies had widely varying shares of the total. NPS had the largest portion, 62%, based on an estimate of $11.92 billion. The FS share was 27% of the total, with an estimated deferred maintenance of $5.20 billion. The FWS portion was 7%, reflecting the agency's deferred maintenance of $1.30 billion. BLM had the smallest share, 5%",

    "crs_R45706": "The nuclear power industry is facing severe economic challenges in the United States. High capital costs, low electricity demand growth, and competition from cheaper sources of electricity such as natural gas and renewables have dampened the demand for new nuclear power plants and accelerated the retirement of existing reactors. As of April 2019, seven nuclear reactors had closed in the United States since 2012, and another 12 had announced that they would retire by 2025. There are currently 98 operating U.S. reactors. As aging reactors reach the end of their operating licenses in 2030 and beyond, the number of retirements is projected to increase. In addition, cost and schedule overruns have hindered recent efforts to build new nuclear units in the United States. The only power reactors currently under construction in the United States\u2014two new units at the Vogtle nuclear plant in Georgia\u2014are five years behind schedule and nearly double their original estimated cost. All nuclear power in the United States is generated by light water reactors (LWRs), which were commercialized in the 1950s and early 1960s and are now used throughout most of the world. LWRs are cooled by ordinary (\"light\") water, which also slows (\"moderates\") the neutrons that maintain the nuclear fission chain reaction. Conventional LWRs are large\u2014with 1,000 megawatt-hours of electricity or more\u2014in order to spread their high construction costs among the maximum possible number of kilowatt-hours of electricity over their operating lifetime. At the same time conventional reactors are facing an uncertain future, some in Congress contend that more nuclear power plants, not fewer, are needed to help reduce U.S. greenhouse gas emissions and bring low-carbon power to the majority of the world that currently has little access to electricity. Proponents of this view argue that the key to increasing the number of nuclear power plants is investment in \"advanced\" nuclear technologies, which they say could overcome the economic problems, safety concerns, and other issues that have stalled the growth of conventional LWRs. Congress enacted legislation in September 2018 that defines \"advanced nuclear reactor\" as \"a nuclear fission reactor with significant improvements over the most recent generation of nuclear fission reactors\" or a reactor using nuclear fusion (P.L. 115-248).

    "crs_R45691": "Bosnia is a small, parliamentary republic with a high degree of decentralization. Its complex, tiered structure includes a central (\"state-level\") government, two ethnoterritorial entities (Republika Srpska and the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina), and a complex, tiered cantonal and municipal government. The Dayton Peace Agreement ended the 1992-1995 war between Bosniaks and Croats. It recognizes three \"constituent peoples\": Bosniaks, Croats, and Serbs. All three groups are Slavic. Religious tradition is considered a marker of difference among the three ethnic identities: Bosniaks are predominantly Muslim, Serbs are largely Orthodox Christian, and Croats are mostly Catholic. Although Bosnia has experienced episodes of communal violence and bloodshed, most recently during World War II and the 1992-1995 war, its heterogeneous population also has lived in mixed communities for periods of peace. Many experts contend that ethnic conflict often was stoked by domestic leaders who manipulated historical memory and grievances to further their own agendas, or by external powers seeking to rule Bosnia or annex its territory. Bosnia's complex political system is a product of the Dayton Agreement; one of its annexes serves as Bosnia's constitution (Annex 4). Its provisions partly reflect the situation on the ground in 1995, including the subdivision of Bosnia into two ethnoterritorial entities: Republika Srpska (\"RS\"), which Bosnian Serb leaders had proclaimed in 1992, and the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina (\"FBiH,\" predominantly populated by Bosniaks and Croats), which was created by the 1994 Washington Agreement. Entity borders were largely drawn to form ethnic majorities, even though they also reflected territorial seizure and ethnic cleansing. Many Bosniaks view the division of Bosnia into these roughly equal entities as awarding the spoils of war to Bosnian Serbs, whom they regard as the aggressors. Many Bosnian Serbs, however, view the Serb-majority entity as a protection against marginalization. The Dayton Agreement established a strong oversight role for the international community.

    "crs_R42045": "The Small Business Lending Fund (SBLF) was enacted as part of a larger effort to enhance the supply of capital to small businesses. Advocates argued that the SBLF would help to address the decline in small business lending and create jobs. Opponents contended that the SBLF could lose money, lacked sufficient oversight provisions, did not require lenders to increase their lending to small businesses, could serve as a vehicle for the Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP) recipients to effectively refinance their TARP loans on more favorable terms with little or no resulting benefit for small businesses, and could encourage a failing lender to make even riskier loans to avoid higher dividend payments. The SBLF's advocates argued that the fund was an important part of a larger effort to enhance the supply of small business loans. After describing the program's structure, the report then examines other arguments that were presented both for and against the program's enactment. Advocates claimed the SBLF would increase lending to small businesses and, in turn, create jobs. Opponents contended that the SBLF could lose money, lacked sufficient oversight provisions, did not require lenders to increase their lending to small businesses, could serve as a vehicle for TARP recipients to effectively refinance their TARP loans on more favorable terms with little or no resulting benefit for small businesses, and could encourage a failing lender to make even riskier loans to avoid higher dividend payments. The report concludes with an examination of the SBLF's implementation by the Department of the Treasury and a discussion of bills introduced during recent Congresses to amend the SBLF. For example, during the 112th Congress, S. 681, the Greater Accountability in the Lending Fund Act of 2011, would have, among other provisions, limited the program's authority to 15 years from enactment and prohibited TARP recipients from participating in the program.

    "crs_R45732": "A plaintiff injured by a defendant's wrongful conduct may file a tort lawsuit to recover money from that defendant. To name an especially familiar example of a tort, \"a person who causes a crash by negligently driving a vehicle is generally liable to the victim of that crash.\" By forcing people who wrongfully injure others to pay money to their victims, the tort system serves at least two functions: (1) \"deter[ring] people from injuring others\" and (2) \"compensat[ing] those who are injured.\" Employees and officers of the federal government occasionally commit torts just like other members of the general public. Until the mid-20th century, however, the principle of \"sovereign immunity\"\u2014a legal doctrine that bars private citizens from suing a sovereign government without its consent\u2014prohibited plaintiffs from suing the United States for the tortious actions of federal officers and employees. Thus, for a substantial portion of this nation's history, persons injured by torts committed by the federal government's agents were generally unable to obtain financial compensation through the judicial system. Congress, deeming this state of affairs unacceptable, ultimately enacted the Federal Tort Claims Act (FTCA) in 1946. The FTCA allows plaintiffs to file and prosecute certain types of tort lawsuits against the United States and thereby potentially recover financial compensation from the federal government. Some FTCA lawsuits are relatively mundane; for instance, a civilian may sue the United States to obtain compensation for injuries sustained as a result of minor accidents on federal property. Other FTCA cases, however, involve grave allegations of government misfeasance. For example, after naval officers allegedly sexually assaulted several women at the infamous Tailhook Convention in 1991, those women invoked the FTCA in an attempt to hold the United States liable for those officers' attacks. Family members of persons killed in the 1993 fire at the Branch Davidian compound in Waco likewise sued the United States under the FTCA, asserting that federal law enforcement agents committed negligent acts that resulted in the deaths of their relatives. Additionally, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the First Circuit affirmed an award of over $100 million against the United States in an FTCA case alleging that the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) committed \"egreg",
    "crs_R42875": "The Federal Housing Administration (FHA) was established by the National Housing Act of 1934 and became part of the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) in 1965. It insures private lenders against losses on certain home mortgages. If the borrower does not repay the mortgage and the home goes to foreclosure, FHA pays the lender the remaining amount that the borrower owes (that is, it pays a claim to the lender). FHA charges borrowers fees, called premiums, in exchange for the insurance. FHA insurance is intended to encourage lenders to offer mortgages to some borrowers who otherwise might be unable to access mortgage credit at affordable interest rates or at all. For example, FHA requires a smaller down payment than many other types of mortgages, potentially making it easier for lower-wealth borrowers, first-time homebuyers, or others for whom a large down payment may present a barrier to homeownership to obtain a mortgage. To qualify for FHA insurance, both the borrower and the mortgage must meet certain criteria. For example, the principal balance of the mortgage must be under a certain dollar threshold. Lenders that originate FHA-insured mortgages must be approved by FHA. The Mutual Mortgage Insurance Fund (MMI Fund) is intended to be self-supporting. It is meant to pay for costs related to insured loans (such as insurance claims paid to lenders) with money it earns on those loans (such as through premiums paid by borrowers), not through appropriations. The MMI Fund is also required to maintain a capital ratio of 2% to help pay for any unexpected increases in losses on its insured mortgages, beyond the losses that it currently anticipates. (Capital in this context is defined as the assets that the MMI Fund currently has on hand, plus the net present value of future cash flows associated with the mortgages that it currently insuring.) The capital ratio is the ratio of capital to the total dollar amount of mortgages insured under the MMI Fund. The capital ratio is calculated on the basis of the actuarial report. The capital ratio fell below the required 2% threshold in FY2009 and then turned negative for a period of time.

The resulting apportionments are widely used to evaluate how individual states benefit from federal highway assistance relative to other states. Although the procedure currently used to distribute federal highway funds is written into law and programs receiving funds in this manner are frequently referred to as \"formula programs,\" the statutory language does not describe any formula in a straightforward way. In consequence, it can be difficult to understand how the apportionment of funds is determined, and whether that apportionment adequately reflects considerations that may be of concern to Members of Congress.

The HUBZone program is \"a place-based contracting assistance program whose primary objective is job creation and increasing capital investment in distressed communities.\" It was authorized in 1997 (P.L. 105-135, the HUBZone Act of 1997; Title VI of the Small Business Reauthorization Act of 1997), and the SBA began accepting applications from interested small businesses on March 22, 1999. The HUBZone program provides participating small businesses located in areas with low income, high poverty, or high levels of unemployment with contracting opportunities in the form of set-asides, sole-source awards, and price-evaluation preferences. The Competition in Contracting Act of 1984 generally requires \"full and open competition\" for government procurement contracts. However, procurement set-asides are permissible competitive procedures. A set-aside restricts competition for a federal contract to specified contractors. In this case, the competition may be restricted to SBA-certified HUBZone businesses if there is a reasonable expectation of at least two SBA-certified HUBZone bidders and a fair market price. In FY2017, the federal government awarded 81,082 contracts valued at $7.53 billion to HUBZone-certified businesses. About $1.90 billion of that amount was awarded with a HUBZone preference ($1.49 billion through a HUBZone set-aside, $65.3 million through a HUBZone sole-source award, and $346.9 million through a HUBZone price-evaluation preference). The remaining $4.10 billion was awarded with another small business preference (e.g., set aside and sole source awards for small business generally and for 8(a), women-owned, and service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses).

In recent years, the federal government has annually made available more than $100 billion in federal grants, loans, and work-study funds to millions of students to help cover the cost of higher education. As Congress continues to focus on expanding access to postsecondary education through federal student aid policies, understanding various characteristics of the population enrolling in postsecondary education may be helpful in informing policy deliberations. In academic year (AY) 2015-2016, there were approximately 19.3 million students enrolled as undergraduates in postsecondary education in the 50 states and the District of Columbia. In AY2007-2008, around the time of the last reauthorization of the Higher Education Act (HEA), there were approximately 20.5 million undergraduate students enrolled in postsecondary education. The composition of the current undergraduate population, how the composition has changed over time, and the types of institutions in which students enroll are issues that are likely to be of interest to Congress as it considers the reauthorization of the HEA. This report focuses on the income of the undergraduate student population. The report will explore the relationship between student income and certain student demographics such as race and dependency status, and explore how the income distribution of the undergraduate population compares with that of the national population of persons who do not have a postsecondary degree. The analysis presented in this report relies on two data sources: the National Postsecondary Student Aid Study (NPSAS) and the Current Population Survey Annual Social and Economic Supplement (CPS ASEC). The NPSAS data are used in this report to explore the income characteristics of the postsecondary population and the extent to which income is related to other student demographics, such as race and dependency status. The report also explores the relationship between income and type of institution(s) attended. To establish a student's income, the NPSAS variable for income as a percentage of the poverty guidelines is used. The poverty guidelines are based on family size and total income. One advantage of using the poverty guidelines is that they provide income relative to the level of poverty at a certain point in time. Therefore, when looking at trends in income over time, no adjustments need be made for inflation. The individual(s) (",

Data flows enable companies to transmit information for online communication, track global supply chains, share research, and provide cross-border services. One study estimates that digital commerce relying on data flows drives 22% of global economic output, and that global GDP will increase by another $2 trillion by 2020 due to advances in emerging technologies. However, while cross-border data flows increase productivity and enable innovation, they also raise concerns around the security and privacy of the information being transmitted. Cross-border data flows are central to trade and trade negotiations as organizations rely on the transmission of information to use cloud services, and to send nonpersonal corporate data as well as personal data to partners, subsidiaries, and customers. U.S. policymakers are considering various policy options to address online privacy, some of which could affect cross-border data flows. For example, new consumer rights to control their personal data may impact how companies can use such data. To enable international data flows and trade, the United States has aimed to eliminate trade barriers and establish enforceable international rules and best practices that allow policymakers to achieve public policy objectives, including promoting online security and privacy. Building consensus for international rules and norms on data flows and privacy has become increasingly important as recent incidents have heightened the public's awareness of the risk of personal data stored online. For many policymakers, the crux of the issue is: How can governments protect individual privacy in the least trade-restrictive way possible? The question is similar to concerns raised about ensuring cybersecurity while allowing the free flow of data. In recent years, Congress has examined multiple issues related to cross-border data flows and online privacy. In the 115th Congress, congressional committees held hearings on these topics, introduced multiple bills, and conducted oversight over federal laws on related issues such as data breach notification. Members are introducing new bills and holding hearings in the 116th Congress. Congress may consider the proposed U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) and examine the digital trade chapter as an example of how to address the issues through trade agreements.",

In the early 1980s, 16 Latin American and Caribbean countries were governed by authoritarian regimes, both on the left and the right. Today, most governments are elected democracies, at least formally. The threat to elected governments from their own militaries has dissipated in most countries. Free and fair elections have become the norm in most countries in the region, although elections in several countries have been controversial and contested. In 2017, the Bahamas, Ecuador, and Chile held successful elections for heads of government. Elections in Honduras in November 2017, however, were characterized by significant irregularities, with the Secretary General of the Organization of American States calling for new elections to be held.

The 115th Congress rejected many of the Trump Administration's proposed cuts in foreign assistance to Latin America and the Caribbean for FY2018 in the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2018 (P.L. 115-141). Congress provided an estimated $1.7 billion in foreign aid to the region, about 55% more than the Administration had requested for FY2018. Likewise, for FY2019, both the House and Senate Appropriations Committees reported out bills (H.R",
    "crs_R45533": "The impact of state and municipal money-bail systems on indigent criminal defendants has prompted legislative interest in, and judicial challenges to, such systems. Money-bail systems allow defendants to avoid jail while awaiting trial by posting a bond according to a fee schedule. Typically, judges do not assess a detainee's individual characteristics beyond the offense charged; instead, judges set a defendant's bail based on the criminal offense with which he is charged. Defendants who cannot pay bail may remain detained pending trial. Money-bail systems differ from the federal bail system, which gives judicial officers greater discretion over the conditions of a defendant's pretrial release. Federal law also expressly provides that a \"judicial officer may not impose a financial condition that results in the pretrial detention of the person.\" The Constitution governs pretrial detention and bail. For money-bail systems, particularly as they apply to indigent defendants, the key provisions are the Eighth Amendment's Excessive Bail Clause and the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments' Due Process and Equal Protection Clauses. The Eighth Amendment expressly prohibits excessive bail, but it does not establish an absolute right to bail. Whether an accused has a right to bail depends on how expansively a court interprets the provision. For example, in Stack v. Boyle, the Court declared that \"[t]here can be no equal justice where the trial a man gets depends on the amount of money he has,\" and held that the government may have legitimate interests in limiting the availability of bail, even for noncapital crimes, based not only on possible flight risk but also on other considerations, including the danger an arrestee poses to public safety or specific members of the community. Nonetheless, the Court has also observed that pretrial detention may have negative consequences for criminal defendants, such as by impairing their ability to maintain employment and to support dependents financially. The impact of state and municipal money-bail systems on indigent criminal defendants has prompted legislative interest in, and judicial challenges to, such systems. Money-bail systems allow defendants to avoid jail while awaiting trial by posting a bond according to a fee schedule. Typically, judges do not assess a detainee'",

(The amendment does not pertain to concurrent or simple resolutions.) The Constitutional Authority Statement (CAS) rule, found at House Rule XII, clause 7(c), was subsequently adopted in the 113th, 114th, 115th, and 116th Congresses. As the CAS rule begins its ninth year, the requirement continues to be a topic of congressional debate and inquiry, as Members of the House contemplate how to comply with the rule prior to every submission of a bill or joint resolution. This report aims to aid in understanding the CAS requirement. It begins by providing a broad overview of (1) Congress's powers under the Constitution and (2) Congress's role in interpreting this document. The report then specifically addresses House Rule XII, clause 7(c), discussing its key requirements and limits, the legal effect of a CAS, and the debate over the rule's value. The report concludes by discussing trends with regard to the House's recent CAS practices and by providing considerations for congressional personnel drafting CASs. The report contains two tables: Table 1 identifies the constitutional provisions most commonly cited in CASs during the last six months of the 114th and 115th Congresses, and Table 2 lists suggested constitutional authorities for various types of legislation.",

Article II, Section 2, appoints the President as the commander-in-chief, with the implied power to deploy, and redeploy, the armed forces as necessary for national defense. In common practice, this has included the authority to create and close military installations needed to accommodate and train personnel under the President's command. However, Article I, Section 8, charges Congress with the responsibility to raise armies, maintain a Navy, and regulate the militia. Through annual authorization and appropriation legislation, Congress legislates policy for managing DOD real property assets and funds the construction, maintenance, operation, and disposal of military infrastructure. The modern Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC) process refers to a temporary authority that amends the Defense Base Closure and Realignment Act of 1990 (P.L. 101-510), hereinafter referred to as the Base Closure Act, and features a framework of elements that entrusts an independent commission with certifying closure and realignment recommendations made by the Secretary of Defense. In general, the process has required the Secretary to submit a list of military installations recommended for closure or realignment to an independent, bipartisan BRAC commission. After analyzing the Secretary's recommendations, the commission may accept, reject, or modify the list. Upon completing its review, the commission forwards its final findings and recommendations to the President. Upon acceptance of commission's recommendations, the President then submits them to Congress. If the President does not submit the recommendations to Congress within the timeframe required under the Base Closure Act, the BRAC process is terminated. Upon receipt of the report from the President, Congress has the opportunity to disapprove of the recommendations in toto through the enactment of a joint resolution. The hallmarks of this framework include establishment of an independent commission whose members are appointed by the President, in consultation with congressional leadership (and the advice and consent of the Senate); reliance on objective and uniform criteria for evaluating basing recommendations; GAO review and certification of DOD data; deliberations that include open hearings, solicitation of feedback, installation visits, and data available for public review; requirement that the commission's final list of closure and realignment actions be accepted or rejected in its entirety; and presidential and",

Four agencies (referred to in this report as the federal land management agencies, or FLMAs) administer a total of 608 million acres (95%) of these federal lands: the Forest Service (FS) in the Department of Agriculture (USDA), and the Bureau of Land Management (BLM), U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS), and National Park Service (NPS), all in the Department of the Interior (DOI). Most of these lands are in the West and Alaska, where the percentage of federal ownership is significantly higher than elsewhere in the nation. In addition, the Department of Defense administers approximately 11 million acres in military bases, training ranges, and more; and numerous other agencies administer the remaining federal acreage. The federal estate also extends to energy and mineral resources located below ground and offshore. BLM manages the federal onshore subsurface mineral estate. The Bureau of Ocean and Energy Management (BOEM), also in DOI, manages access to about 1.7 billion offshore acres located beyond state coastal waters, referred to as U.S. offshore areas or the outer continental shelf (OCS). Not all of these acres can be expected to contain extractable mineral and energy resources, however. Federal land policy and management issues generally fall into several broad thematic questions: Should federal land be managed to produce national or local benefits? How should current uses be balanced with future resources and opportunities? Should current uses, management, and protection programs be replaced with alternatives? Who decides how federal land resources should be managed, and how are the decisions made? Some stakeholders seek to maintain or enhance the federal estate, while others seek to divest the federal estate to state or private ownership. Some issues, such as forest management and fire protection, involve both federal and nonfederal (state, local, or privately owned) land. In many cases, policy positions on federal land issues do not divide along clear party lines. Instead, they may be split along the lines of rural-urban, eastern-western, and coastal-interior interests. Several committees in the House and Senate have jurisdiction over federal land issues. For example, issues involving the management of the national forests cross multiple committee jurisdictions, including the Committee on Agriculture and the Committee on Natural Resources in the House, and the Committee",

Appropriations for the Department of Justice (DOJ) provide funding for agencies such as the Federal Bureau of Investigation; the Bureau of Prisons; the U.S. Marshals Service; the Drug Enforcement Administration; and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives, along with funding for a variety of grant programs for state, local, and tribal governments. The vast majority of funding for the science agencies goes to the National Aeronautics and Space Administration and the National Science Foundation. The annual appropriation for the related agencies includes funding for agencies such as the Legal Services Corporation and the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. The Administration requested $66.555 billion for CJS for FY2019, which was 6.2% less than FY2018 regular funding. When comparing the Administration's FY2019 request to the FY2018 funding, it should be considered that the Administration formulated its FY2019 budget request before full-year appropriations for FY2018 were enacted. FY2018 funding levels, for the purposes of the Administration's request, were calculated based on FY2017 funding minus a reduction (0.6791%) as extended under a series of continuing resolutions. The Administration requested the following: $9.797 billion for the Department of Commerce, which was 12.0% less than FY2018 regular funding; $28.835 billion for the Department of Justice, which was 4.8% less than FY2018 regular funding; $27.372 billion for the science agencies, which was 4.0% less than FY2018 regular funding; and $551 million for the related agencies, which was 43.4% less than FY2018 regular funding.

Qatar's governing structure approximates that of the other GCC states. The country is led by a hereditary Amir (literally \"prince,\" but interpreted as \"ruler\"), Shaykh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani. He became ruler in June 2013 when his father, Amir Hamad bin Khalifa Al Thani, relinquished power voluntarily. The Amir governs through a prime minister, who is a member of the Al Thani family, and a cabinet, several of whom are members of the Al Thani family or of prominent allied families. There is dissent within the Al Thani family\u2014mostly from those of lineages linked to ousted former Qatari rulers\u2014but no significant challenge to Tamim's rule is evident. There were no significant protests in Qatar during the \"Arab Spring\" uprising of 2011 or since.

Despite these developments, the role of cash in the payment system has begun to decline. Some observers have examined the consequences of an evolution away from cash. Proponents of reducing the use of physical currency (or even eliminating it all together and becoming a cashless society) argue that it will generate important benefits, including potentially improved efficiency of the payment system, a reduction of crime, and less constrained monetary policy. Proponents of maintaining cash as a payment option argue that significant reductions in cash usage and acceptance would further marginalize people with limited access to the financial system, increase the financial system's vulnerability to cyberattack, and reduce personal privacy. Given developments and debate in this area, Congress may consider policy issues related to the declining use of cash relative to electronic forms of payment. This report analyzes cash and noncash payment systems, and the potential outcomes if cash were to be significantly displaced as a commonly accepted form of payment. The first part analyzes cash and noncash payment systems, and the second analyzes potential outcomes if cash were to be significantly displaced as a commonly accepted form of payment. The first part describes the characteristics of cash and the various electronic payment systems that could potentially supplant cash. The noncash payment systems include traditional electronic payment systems (such as credit cards or payment apps) and alternative electronic payment systems, focusing on private systems using distributed ledger technology (such as cryptocurrencies) and central bank digital currencies (which are only under consideration by central banks at this time). Part I also examines the advantages and costs specific to each payment system and the potential obstacles to the adoption of alternative electronic payment systems. Part II of this report analyzes the potential implications of a reduced role of cash payments in the economy, including potential benefits, costs, and risks.

From 2006 to 2016, the number of individuals living in the United States who were born in the Northern Triangle grew from 2.2 million to almost 3 million; this increase (37%) was more than twice the increase for the total foreign-born population (16%). During the same period, the foreign-born population from Mexico living in the United States held steady at 11.5 million (which is more than any other country-of-birth group). In 2016, the foreign-born population from the Northern Triangle comprised less than 1.0% of the U.S. population and 6.8% of the 43.7 million foreign-born residents of the United States, up from 5.8% in 2006. Even though total apprehensions of illegal border crossers were at a 45-year low in FY2017, the number of families from the Northern Triangle apprehended at the U.S.-Mexico border has increased in recent years. While earlier migrants apprehended at the Southwest border were predominantly single, adult males from Mexico, currently the majority of apprehended migrants are families and unaccompanied children, and the majority of apprehended migrants come from the Northern Triangle. An increasing share of those arriving at the Southwest border are requesting asylum, some at official ports of entry and others after entering the United States \"without inspection\" (i.e., illegally) between U.S. ports of entry. This is adding to a large backlog of asylum cases in U.S. immigration courts. In the past year, news reports of migrant \"caravans\" from the Northern Triangle traveling toward the U.S. border have sparked intense interest and many questions from Congress, including the following: What factors are contributing to the increase in migration from the Northern Triangle to the United States? Is the choice to migrate in large groups a new trend? How are the United States, Mexico, and Central American governments responding?

It has been a close ally of the Soviet Union since the end of the Cold War, and its economy has grown significantly since the mid-1990s. The United States has imposed sanctions on Cuba since the end of the Cold War, and the United States has imposed sanctions on Cuba since the early 1960s. In 2009, Congress took legislative action in an appropriations measure (P.L. 111-8) to ease restrictions on family travel and travel for the marketing of agricultural exports, marking the first congressional action easing Cuba sanctions in almost a decade. The Obama Administration took further action in 2009 by lifting restrictions on family travel and family remittances and in 2011 by further easing restrictions on educational and religious travel and remittances to other than family members. President Obama announced a major shift in U.S. policy toward Cuba in December 2014 that moved away from a sanctions-based policy aimed at isolating Cuba toward a policy of engagement and a normalization of relations. The policy shift led to the restoration of diplomatic relations, the rescission of Cuba's designation as a state sponsor of international terrorism, and the easing of some restrictions on travel and commerce with Cuba. There was mixed reaction in Congress, with some Members of Congress supporting the change and others opposing it. Legislative initiatives in the 114th Congress in 2015-2016 reflected this policy divide, with some bills introduced that would have further eased U.S. economic sanctions and others that would have blocked the policy shift and introduced new sanctions; ultimately no action was taken on either policy approach. President Trump announced a new policy approach toward Cuba in June 2017 that partially rolled back efforts to normalize relations and imposed new sanctions on Cuba, including restrictions on the permissible category of people-to-people educational travel to Cuba and on transactions with companies controlled by the Cuban military. There was mixed reaction in Congress, with some Members of Congress supporting the change and others opposing it. Legislative initiatives in the 115th Congress in 2017-2018 were mixed, with legislative initiatives reflecting the policy divide between those wanting to tighten sanctions and those wanting to ease them.

Between 1990 and 2008, Congress passed legislation imposing various sanctions on Burma in part due to the serious human rights violations committed by and/or authorized by the Tatmadaw. Such allegations of intentional, pervasive, and systematic abuses arose again following the forced displacement of over 700,000 Rohingya from Burma's Rakhine State in late 2017, as well as the Tatmadaw's renewed offensive against ethnic armed groups in Kachin, Karen, and Shan States. The Trump Administration has described that Tatmadaw's assault on the Rohingya as \"ethnic cleansing\" and has applied \"limited targeted sanctions\" on five Tatmadaw officers and two military units. On December 13, 2018, the House of Representatives passed H.Res. 1091 (116th Congress), stating \"the atrocities committed against the Rohingya by the Burmese military and security forces since August 2017 constitute crimes against humanity and genocide\" and calling on the Secretary of State to \"determine, based on available evidence, whether the actions by the Burmese military in northern Rakhine State in 2017 constitute crimes against humanity, genocide, or other crimes under international law.\" Various organizations\u2014including the United Nations Independent International Fact-Finding Mission in Myanmar (UNFFM), multiple human rights organizations, and the press\u2014have conducted investigations into allegations that Burmese security forces committed serious human rights violations in Burma's seven ethnic states since the Tatmadaw transferred power to a mixed civilian/military government in 2011. These organizations have released at least 17 reports documenting evidence that appears to support some of these allegations, and implicates specific Burmese security personnel and units as being responsible for the abuses.

A joint resolution of disapproval will become effective once both houses of Congress pass a joint resolution and it is signed by the President, or if Congress overrides the President's veto. For an agency's action to be eligible for review under the CRA, it must qualify as a \"rule\" as defined by the statute. The class of rules covered by the CRA is broader than the category of rules that are subject to the Administrative Procedure Act's (APA's) notice-and-comment requirements. As such, some agency actions, such as guidance documents, that are not subject to notice-and-comment rulemaking procedures may still be considered rules under the CRA and thus could be overturned using the CRA's procedures. The 115th Congress used the CRA to pass, for the first time, a resolution of disapproval overturning an agency guidance document that had not been promulgated through notice-and-comment procedures. The resolution was signed into law by the President on May 21, 2018. In all of the previous instances in which the CRA was used to overturn agency actions, the disapproved actions were regulations that had been adopted through APA rulemaking processes. Congress's use of the CRA in this instance raised questions about the scope of the CRA and Congress's ability to use the CRA to overturn agency actions that were not promulgated through APA notice-and-comment procedures. Under the CRA, the expedited procedures for considering legislation to overturn rules become available only when agencies submit their rules to Congress. In many cases in which agencies take actions that meet the legal definition of a \"rule\" but have not gone through notice-and-comment rulemaking procedures, however, agencies fail to submit those rules. Thus, questions have arisen as to how Members can use the CRA's procedures to overturn agency actions when an agency does not submit the action to Congress.

The essential distinction between whistleblowers generally and those in the IC (or those who otherwise have security clearances) is the concern for protecting classified information that may be involved in an IC-related incident or complaint. The IC has recognized that whistleblowing can save taxpayers' dollars, help ensure an ethical and safe working environment, and enable timely responses for corrective action. Congress and the executive branch have defined in statute and directives procedures for IC whistleblowers to make protected disclosures that also provide for the security of classified information. The Director of National Intelligence (DNI) whistleblowing policy and guidance is publicly available and specifically addresses whistleblower process and protections for IC contractors, members of the Armed Forces, and federal employees. There are differing opinions, however, on whether the IC's internal processes have the transparency necessary to ensure adequate protections against reprisal, and whether protections for IC contractors are sufficient. IC whistleblower protections have evolved in response to perceptions of gaps that many believed left whistleblowers vulnerable to reprisal. The first whistleblower legislation specific to the IC was the Intelligence Community Whistleblower Protection Act (ICWPA) of 1998. It was limited to specifying a process for an IC whistleblower to make a complaint but offered no specific protections. The Intelligence Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2010 included provisions for protecting IC whistleblowers, though these were general and subject to different standards of implementation. Presidential Policy Directive (PPD)-19, signed in 2012, provided the first specific protections in response to perceptions that IC whistleblowers remained vulnerable to reprisal actions for making a complaint.

    "crs_R42566": "A range of federal incentives supports the development and deployment of alternatives to conventional fuels and engines in transportation. These incentives include tax deductions and credits for vehicle purchases and the installation of refueling systems, federal grants for conversion of older vehicles to newer technologies, mandates for the use of biofuels, and incentives for manufacturers to produce alternative fuel vehicles. Some of these incentives have expired in recent years when their authorizations expired. Many of the policy choices presented for alternative fuel and advanced vehicle technologies originated as a response to the nation's interest in reducing petroleum imports, a goal first articulated at the time of the two oil embargoes imposed by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) in the 1970s. While President Richard Nixon is often cited as the first President to call for \"energy independence,\" successive Presidents and Congresses have made efforts to reduce petroleum import dependence as well. Factors in this reversal include the last recession, which reduced domestic demand, followed by a rise in the supply of U.S. oil and oil alternatives due to increased private sector investment and federal incentives, some of which are cited in this report. In addition to concerns over petroleum import dependence, other factors also have driven policy on alternative fuels and advanced vehicle technologies. Federal incentives do not reflect a single, comprehensive strategy but rather an aggregative approach to a range of discrete public policy issues, including improving environmental quality, expanding domestic manufacturing, and promoting agriculture and rural development. Alternative fuels programs can be generally classified into six categories: expanding domestic ethanol production; establishing other alternative fuels; encouraging the purchase of nonpetroleum vehicles; reducing fuel consumption and greenhouse gas emissions; supporting U.S. vehicle manufacturing; and funding U.S. highways. The federal tax incentives and programs discussed in this report aim to support the development and deployment of alternative fuels. There is no central coordination of how these incentives interact. In general, they are independently administered by separate federal agencies, including five agencies: Department of the Treasury, DOE, DOT, EPA, and USDA. This report focuses strictly on programs that directly support alternative fuels or advanced vehicles. It does not address more general programs (e.g., general manufacturing loans, rural development loans), or programs that have been authorized but never funded.

In recent years, widespread concerns about the federal debt, recent and projected federal budget deficits, and federal budget caps have driven difficult decisions about the prioritization of R&D, both in the context of the entire federal budget and among competing needs within the federal R&D portfolio. Increases in the budget caps for FY2018 and FY2019 reduced some of the pressure affecting these decisions, but the concerns remain and the caps for FY2020 have not been increased. The U.S. government supports a broad range of scientific and engineering R&D. Its purposes include specific concerns such as addressing national defense, health, safety, the environment, and energy security; advancing knowledge generally; developing the scientific and engineering workforce; and strengthening U.S. innovation and competitiveness in the global economy. Most of the R&D funded by the federal government is performed in support of the unique missions of individual funding agencies. The federal R&D budget is an aggregation of the R&D activities of these agencies. There is no single, centralized source of R&D funds. Agency R&D budgets are developed internally as part of each agency's overall budget development process. R&D funding may be included either in accounts that are entirely devoted to R&D or in accounts that include funding for non-R&D activities. Agency R&D budgets are subjected to review, revision, and approval by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and become part of the President's annual budget submission to Congress.

The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) is funded through the Agriculture appropriations bill in the House and the FSGG bill in the Senate. Where the CFTC is funded upon enactment depends on which chamber originated the law, which typically alternates annually. Thus, the enacted amounts for the CFTC typically are in the Agriculture appropriations bill one year and FSGG the following year. This structure has existed in its current form since the 2007 reorganization of the House and Senate Committees on Appropriations. Although financial services are a major focus of the bill, the FSGG appropriations bill does not include funding for many financial regulatory agencies, which are instead funded outside of the appropriations process. It is not uncommon for legislative provisions addressing various financial regulatory issues to be included in titles at the end of the bill. President Trump submitted his FY2019 budget request on February 12, 2018. The request included a total of $49.1 billion for agencies funded through the FSGG appropriations bill, including $282 million for the CFTC. This total included a proposed legislative provision on government-wide transfer authority in Section 737, which was estimated at $3 billion by the appropriations committees. The House Committee on Appropriations reported a Financial Services and General Government Appropriations Act, 2019 (H.R. 6258, H.Rept. 115-792) on June 15, 2018. Total FY2019 funding in the reported bill would have beeneen $45.7 billion, with another $255 million for the CFTC included in the Agriculture appropriations bill (H.R. 5961, H.Rept. 115-706). The combined total of $45.9 billion would have been about $3.2 billion below the President's",
    "crs_R45492": "The 116th Congress may conduct oversight and deliberate on authorizations and appropriations legislation related to water resource development, management, and protection. Demands on available water supplies have heightened local and regional water-use conflicts throughout the country, particularly in the West and Southeast. Development pressures, droughts and floods, and concerns about changing hydrology from land-use change and climate change engender nonfederal interest in federal financial and technical assistance for water resource science and projects. There is interest in new water resource infrastructure (e.g., storm surge gates, water storage) and new kinds of projects (e.g., groundwater recharge projects, nature-based flood risk reduction). In addition, there is interest in reinvestment in aging water resource infrastructure and in improved management of available supplies through water science, monitoring, and operational changes. Water resource policy questions relevant to the 116th Congress include the following: What will be the federal role in maintaining the performance and safety of existing water resource infrastructure? Under what conditions and how should the federal government be involved in planning and constructing water resource projects? How may federal and nonfederal water resource science, observation, and monitoring be performed and used to inform water resource management and project design and operation? Congress historically has played a role in water resources through authorization of and appropriations for regional and site-specific projects and activities. Some of the projects are for facilitating navigation and expanding water supplies for irrigation and other uses. Other projects are aimed at reducing flood and drought losses and restoring aquatic ecosystems. Congress principally has directed either the Bureau of Reclamation (Reclamation) in the Department of the Interior (DOI) or the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) in the Department of Defense to plan and construct the existing stock of large federal water resource projects. Historically, Reclamation constructed projects in the 17 arid states west of the Mississippi River; these projects were designed principally to provide reliable supplies of water for irrigation and some municipal and industrial uses. USACE constructs projects nationwide that primarily seek to improve navigation, reduce flood damages, and restore aquatic ecosystems. For more on the federal water resource infrastructure, see the Appendix. In addition, Congress authorizes and funds selected water resource science and monitoring activities at multiple federal agencies. DOI's U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) has a prominent role in",

Successive U.S. Administrations have viewed U.S. leadership of NATO as a cornerstone of U.S. national security strategy, bringing benefits ranging from peace and stability in Europe to the political and military support of 28 allies, including many of the world's most advanced militaries. For almost as long as NATO has been in existence, it also has faced criticism. One chief concern of critics in the United States, including some Members of Congress, has been that European allies' reliance on U.S. security guarantees have fostered an imbalanced and unsustainable \"burdensharing\" arrangement by which the United States carries an unfair share of the responsibility for ensuring European security. President Donald Trump has amplified these concerns, and his assertions that NATO is a \"bad deal\" have caused some analysts and policymakers to reassess the costs and benefits to the United States of its long-standing leadership of the alliance. Although successive U.S. presidents have called on the allies to increase defense spending, none has done so as stridently as President Trump. He is also the first U.S. president to publicly suggest that the United States could modify its commitment to NATO should the allies fail to meet agreed defense spending targets. President Trump's supporters, including some Members of Congress, also argue that Trump's forceful statements have succeeded in securing defense spending increases across the alliance that were not forthcoming under his predecessors. Nevertheless, many supporters of NATO, including some allied governments, continue to question the President's commitment to the alliance and worry that his condemnations could damage NATO cohesion and credibility. In the face of these concerns, Congress has demonstrated significant bipartisan support for NATO and U.S. leadership of the alliance. In January 2019, following reports that the President has considered seeking to withdraw the United States from NATO, the House of Representatives passed legislation reaffirming U.S. support for the alliance and limiting the President's authority to withdraw (H.R. 676, passed by a vote of 357-22); similar legislation has been introduced in the Senate (S.J.",

The TIFIA program prog ram, administered by the Build America Bureau of the Department of Transportation (DOT), was reauthorized most recently in the Fixing America's Surface Transportation (FAST) Act (P.L. 114-94) from FY2016 through FY2020. Direct funding for the TIFIA program to make loans is authorized at $300 million for each of FY2019 and FY2020, but state departments of transportation can also use federal-aid highway grant money, both formula and discretionary, to subsidize much larger loans. The primary goal of the TIFIA program, historically, has been to enable the construction of large-scale surface transportation projects by providing low-interest, long-term financing to complement state, local, and private investment. The TIFIA program has been one of the main ways in which the federal government has encouraged the development of public-private partnerships (P3s) and private financing in surface transportation often backed by new, but sometimes uncertain, revenue sources such as highway tolls, other types of user charges, and incremental real estate taxes. Since its enactment in 1998 as part of the Transportation Equity Act for the 21st Century (TEA-21; P.L. 105-178) through FY2018, the TIFIA program has provided assistance of $32 billion to 74 projects with a total cost of about $117 billion (in FY2018 inflation-adjusted dollars). Congress has used the TIFIA program as a model for other initiatives, notably the Water Infrastructure Finance and Innovation Act (WIFIA) program, administered by the Environmental Protection Agency and the Army Corps of Engineers. Several recent proposals would expand TIFIA assistance. For example, the Trump Administration's $200 billion infrastructure plan, based on leveraging state, local, and private resources, proposed adding several billion dollars of budget authority for TIFIA and expanding eligibility to ports and airports. The experience of TIFIA over the past decade shows, however, that there are limits to financing projects in this way. These limits include the number of projects that can take advantage of credit assistance, the difficulties of developing revenue mechanisms to service loans, the typical need for grant funding",
    "crs_R44618": "The Supreme Court's 2008 opinion in District of Columbia v. Heller, which upturned the earlier majority view with its holding that the Second Amendment guarantees an individual right to possess firearms for historically lawful purposes, such as self-defense in the home. But in Heller the Court did not define the full scope of that right, leaving lower courts to fill in the gaps. Indeed, the Court has said little on the matter, most notably by holding that the Second Amendment right is incorporated through the Fourteenth Amendment to apply to the states in McDonald v. City of Chicago. Beyond McDonald, the Court has largely declined to grant certiorari to the numerous Second Amendment cases percolating in the lower federal courts with one exception: In Caetano v. Massachusetts, the Supreme Court\u2014in a single, two page ruling\u2014granted a petition for certiorari and issued an unsigned, per curiam opinion vacating the decision of the Massachusetts Supreme Court that had upheld a state law prohibiting the possession of stun guns. But the Court's opinion did little to clarify Second Amendment jurisprudence, principally noting that the state court opinion directly conflicted with Heller without discussing the matter in further detail. During the October 2019 term, however, the Supreme Court will review a Second Amendment challenge to a New York City firearm licensing provision in New York State Rifle & Pistol Association, Inc. v. City of New York, giving the Court another opportunity to elaborate on the scope of the individual right to keep and bear arms. Accordingly, this report evaluates how the lower federal courts have interpreted Heller and the Second Amendment through challenges to various federal, state, and local firearm laws. In particular, this report focuses on federal appellate decisions, including what categories of persons, firearms, and places may be subject to government firearm regulation, and how federal, state, and local governments may regulate those categories. These appellate decisions include challenges to provisions of the Gun Control Act\u2014the primary federal law regulating the transfer and possession of firearms in interstate commerce\u2014as well as state and local laws that provide further restrictions on the possession and sale of firearms, including assault weapon bans, concealed carry restrictions, and firearm licensing schemes, among others.

Congressional interest in the PMAs has included diverse issues such as rate setting, cost and compliance associated with the Endangered Species Act (ESA; P.L. 93-205; 16 U.S.C. 1531 et seq.), and questions of privatization of these federal agencies. In general, the PMAs came into being because of the government's need to dispose of electric power produced by federal dams constructed largely for irrigation, flood control, or other purposes, and to achieve small community and farm electrification\u2014that is, providing service to customers whom it would not have been profitable for a private utility to serve. With minor exceptions, these agencies market the electric power produced by federal dams constructed, owned, and operated by the Corps of Engineers (Corps) and the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation (BOR). PMAs must give preference to public utility districts and cooperatives (e.g., \"preference customers\"), selling their power at cost-based rates set at the lowest possible rate consistent with sound business principles. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) regulates PMA rates to ensure that they are set high enough to repay the U.S. Treasury on schedule for the portion of federal facility costs that have been allocated to hydropower beneficiaries. Since FY2011, power revenues associated with the PMAs have been classified as discretionary offsetting receipts (i.e., receipts that are available for spending by the PMAs), thus the agencies are sometimes noted as having a \"net-zero\" spending authority. Only the capital expenses of WAPA and SWPA require appropriations from Congress. Each PMA also has unique elements and regional issues that affect its business.

Today, Congress funds a number of programs to help meet the housing needs of poor and vulnerable populations. The programs are primarily administered by the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), with some assistance provided to rural communities through the Department of Agriculture and some tax benefits administered through the Department of the Treasury. The modern housing assistance programs include both relatively flexible grants to state and local governments to serve homeless people, build affordable housing, provide assistance to first-time homebuyers, and promote community development; and more structured, direct assistance programs that provide low-cost apartments and rental vouchers to poor families, administered through local public, quasi-public, and private intermediaries. The federal government also makes tax credits available to states to distribute to developers of low-cost housing and provides mortgage insurance to lenders that make certain types of mortgages to eligible homebuyers or developers of multifamily housing. One of the federal government's largest housing benefits, arguably, is the mortgage interest deduction, which is not targeted to lower-income households and is available to homeowners who pay mortgage interest and itemize their deductions. This report begins with an overview of the history and evolution of federal housing assistance policy. It then provides descriptions of today's major federal housing assistance programs. The report concludes with a discussion of issues and trends in federal housing assistance policy. This report is primarily focused on the federal government's programs and policies that provide housing-related assistance to households and communities to assist lower-income families. This is a narrower focus than the federal government's role in all aspects of housing and housing finance.

Economic modeling indicates that a carbon tax would achieve emission reductions, the level of which would depend on which GHG emissions and sources are covered and the rate of the carbon tax. A carbon tax would generate a new revenue stream. The magnitude of the revenues would depend on the scope and rate of the tax and multiple market factors, which introduce uncertainty in the revenue projections. A carbon tax could apply either directly to GHG emissions or to the materials\u2014based on their carbon contents\u2014that ultimately generate the emissions (i.e., \"emissions inputs\"). A carbon price on emissions or their emissions inputs\u2014mainly fossil fuels\u2014would increase the relative price of the more carbon-intensive energy sources, particularly coal. This result could spur innovation in less carbon-intensive technologies (e.g., renewable energy, nuclear power, carbon capture and sequestration [CCS]) and stimulate other behavior that may decrease emissions, such as efficiency improvements. The energy price increases could also have both economy-wide impacts and negative effects on specific industries and particular demographic groups. A carbon tax approach has received some attention and debate in recent years. In the 115th Congress, Members introduced nine carbon tax or fee proposals. Outside of Congress, the Climate Leadership Council\u2014a bipartisan group of former policymakers and industry leaders\u2014published a conceptual carbon tax approach in 2017 that generated some interest.

Because these pipelines carry volatile, flammable, or toxic materials, they have the potential to injure the public, destroy pr operty, and damage the environment. Although they are generally an efficient and comparatively safe means of transport, pipeline systems are nonetheless vulnerable to accidents, operational failure, and malicious attacks. A series of accidents in California, Pennsylvania, and Massachusetts, among other places, have demonstrated this vulnerability and have heightened congressional concern about U.S. pipeline safety. The Department of Energy's first Quadrennial Energy Review (QER), released in 2015, also highlighted pipeline safety as a growing concern for the nation's energy infrastructure.

According to the National Fire Protection Association (NFPA), in 2015 there were 1,345,500 total fires reported, 3,280 civilian fire deaths, 15,700 civilian fire injuries, and an estimated $14.3 billion in direct property loss. There were 69 on-duty firefighter deaths in 2016. The genesis of USFA and FEMA's fire prevention and control activities can be found in the landmark 1973 report of the National Commission on Fire Prevention and Control, entitled America Burning. The commission recommended the creation of a federal fire agency which would provide support to state and local governments and private fire organizations in their efforts to reduce fire deaths, injuries, and property loss. The commission recommended that this new agency be placed within the Department of Housing and Urban Development. Congress instead opted to place the agency in the Department of Commerce, and with the passage of the Federal Fire Prevention and Control Act of 1974 (P.L. 93-498), the National Fire Prevention and Control Administration (NFPCA) was established. In 1978, Congress changed the name of NFPCA to USFA (P.L. 95-422), and in 1979, President Carter's Reorganization Plan No. 3 placed the USFA within the newly created FEMA. Also in 1979, the National Fire Academy (NFA) in Emmitsburg, MD, was opened, offering courses and training to fire service personnel and other persons engaged in fire prevention and control. During the early 1980s, the Reagan Administration proposed the elimination of the USFA (while preserving the Fire Academy). Although Congress did not allow the termination of the USFA, the agency suffered severe staff reductions and the Fire Academy was separated from the USFA and housed organizationally with other FEMA emergency",
    "crs_R44981": "The 116th Congress, in both its legislative and oversight capacities, faces numerous trade policy issues related to the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) renegotiations and the proposed United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA). On May 18, 2017, the Trump Administration sent a 90-day notification to Congress of its intent to begin talks with Canada and Mexico to renegotiate and modernize NAFTA, as required by the 2015 Trade Promotion Authority (TPA). Talks officially began on August 16, 2017. On September 30, 2018, leaders from the United States, Canada, and Mexico announced the conclusion of the negotiations for a modernized NAFTA, which would now be called the USMCA. On November 30, 2018, the proposed USMCA was signed by President Donald J. Trump, then President Enrique Pea Nieto of Mexico, and Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. President Trump stated his intention to withdraw from or renegotiate NAFTA during his election campaign and has hinted at the possibility of NAFTA withdrawal since he entered into office. Key issues for Congress in regard to the consideration of the proposed USMCA include the constitutional authority of Congress over international trade, its role in revising, approving, or withdrawing from the agreement, U.S. negotiating objectives and the extent to which the proposed agreement makes progress in meeting them as required under TPA. Congress may also consider the agreement's impact on U.S. industries, the U.S. economy, and broader U.S. trade relations with Canada and Mexico, two of the United States' largest trading partners. The proposed USMCA, if approved by Congress, would revise some key provisions such as auto rules of origin, which, some argue roll back longstanding U.S. FTA provisions. On the other hand, it establish new updated provisions in areas such as digital trade and intellectual property rights. A key question for Congress may be whether the agreement strikes the right balance overall. After numerous rounds of negotiations, on August 31, 2018, after the United States and Mexico announced a preliminary U.S.-Mexico agreement, President Trump notified Congress of his intention to \"enter into a trade agreement with Mexico \u2013 and with Canada if it is willing.\" On September 30, 2018, U.S. Trade Representative (USTR) Robert Lighthizer announced that the three countries",

    "crs_R45656": "Congress has long deliberated on drinking water quality and infrastructure, which have been brought to the forefront of national attention by several events. Such events include the detection of elevated lead levels in tap water in Flint, MI, and other cities; hurricanes and other natural disasters that damaged or destroyed community drinking water infrastructure; and local source water contamination events (e.g., chemical spills and algal blooms). Representatives of state drinking water agencies, private sector engineers, and others report that much of the nation's drinking water infrastructure is deteriorating, threatening public health, and increasing operations and maintenance costs. In 2012, the American Water Works Association (AWWA) reported that much of the drinking water infrastructure (more than 1 million miles of buried pipe) was constructed in the 19th and 20th centuries and is nearing the end of its useful life. While disagreement exists over the scope and costs of improvement and replacements, estimates of the funding needs are substantial. In March 2018, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) issued its sixth Drinking Water Infrastructure Needs Survey and Assessment. In this survey, EPA estimated that public water systems would need to invest $472.60 billion for drinking water capital improvements over the next 20 years to achieve compliance and ensure the provision of safe drinking water. Although all projects identified in the needs survey would promote health objectives, EPA reported that 12% of the 20-year estimated need was directly attributed to statutory compliance. The majority (88%) of needs are for ongoing investments, such as repair of aging drinking water infrastructure. In 2012, AWWA conducted a broader drinking water infrastructure survey that reported that the costs to replace aging drinking water infrastructure and expand water service to growing populations will increase to more than $1 trillion over the next 25 years. Communities nationwide may face financial challenges as they manage the need to repair or replace aging drinking water infrastructure. Congress deliberated on several of these drinking water infrastructure issues while developing America's Water Infrastructure Act of 2018 (AWIA; P.L. 115-270), enacted on October 23, 2018. Title I of the act, \"The Water Resource Development Act of 2018,\" authorizes a wide variety of water resource and infrastructure policies, programs, and projects for the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE). Water Resource Development Act bills are often considered on a biennial schedule and have primarily addressed USACE projects. Title III of AWI",

The MSPB also aims to promote an effective federal workforce free of prohibited personnel practices. The MSPB mainly carries out its mission through adjudication of federal employee appeals of adverse actions. When the Board determines that a federal employee has been subject to an improper adverse action, it may order relief, including reinstatement, backpay, and attorney's fees. The Board may also order federal agencies to comply with Board orders, conduct special studies of the civil service and other executive branch merit systems, and review Office of Personnel Management (OPM) rules and regulations to determine, for example, whether a federal agency has invalidly implemented the OPM requirements. This report focuses on the Board's adjudicatory authority. Federal law specifies that the Board consists of three members appointed by the President with the advice and consent of the Senate. However, as of March 2019, the Board lacks any sitting members. Although other MSPB employees, including administrative judges who issue initial decisions in cases, will continue their work, some Members of Congress and others have raised concerns about the extent to which these vacancies limit the agency's ability to perform its other functions. This report discusses the MSPB's establishment and its structure, as well as the role of the Office of Special Counsel, an independent, prosecutorial agency that operates concurrently with the Board.

This included $67.9 billion to be designated by Congress and the President as funding for Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO) and $599.4 billion for DOD's base budget, comprising all operations not designated as OCO. OCO-designated funding is related to current operations in Afghanistan and Syria, but includes other activities that Congress and the President so-designate. As enacted, H.R. 6157 provides $667.3 billion, a net reduction of $1.09 billion amounting to less than two-tenths of 1% of the total (i.e., base budget plus OCO) request. Compared with the total amount provided by the FY2018 defense appropriations bill (P.L. 114-113), the FY2019 act provides an increase of 2.3%. The House initially passed H.R. 6197 on June 28, 2018, by a vote of 359-49. On that same day, the Senate Appropriations Committee reported S. 3159, its own version of the FY2019 Defense Appropriations bill. Subsequently, the Senate adopted several amendments to H.R. 6157, including one that substituted the text of the Senate committee bill for the House-passed text. The Senate then passed H.R. 6197, as amended, on August 23, 2018, by a vote of 85-7. A House-Senate conference committee reported a version of the bill on September 13, 2018.

Most of these acquisitions are governed by numerous statutes and regulations found in Title 10 of the United States Code, the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), and the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement (DFARS). DOD can also enter into certain transactions without triggering most of the standard acquisition statutes and regulations by using other transaction authorities. In recent years, Congress has expanded these authorities and DOD is increasingly using OTs for research, prototyping, and production. This report examines (1) how OTs work, (2) why they were established, (3) potential benefits and risks of using OTs, and (4) whether there are data available against which to measure their effectiveness. Appendix A provides a legislative history of DOD's other transaction authorities. DOD's other transaction authorities are found in two sections of law: 10 U.S.C. 2371 grants DOD the authority to use other transactions to carry out basic, applied, and advanced research projects. DOD regulations treat these projects as financial assistance instruments, not as contracts. Generally, DOD can use other transaction authorities for three purposes: 1. conduct research, 2. develop prototypes, or 3. contract for follow-on production of a successful prototype project.

The Marines cancelled the EFV due to excessive cost growth and poor performance in operational testing. Recognizing the need to replace the AAV, the Pentagon pledged to move quickly to develop a \"more affordable and sustainable\" vehicle to take the place of the EFV. The Amphibious Combat Vehicle (ACV) is intended to replace the AAV, incorporating some EFV capabilities but in a more practical and cost-efficient manner. In concert with the ACV, the Marines were developing the Marine Personnel Carrier (MPC) to serve as a survivable and mobile platform to transport Marines when ashore. At present, the Marines do not have a wheeled armored fighting vehicle that can operate as a dedicated infantry carrier with Marine maneuver forces inland. The MPC was not intended to be amphibious like an AAV, EFV, or the ACV but instead would be required to have a swim capability for inland waterways such as rivers, lakes, and other water obstacles such as shore-to-shore operations in the littorals. Because of a perceived amphibious \"redundancy,\" some have questioned the need for both the ACV and MPC. In June 2013, citing budgetary pressures, the Marines reportedly put the MPC program \"on ice\" and suggested that it might not be resurrected for about 10 years.

The House and Senate restaurant systems have existed since the early 1800s and have grown and modernized over time. Although many of their services may seem similar, food operations are separately administered and managed for the House, for the Senate, and for the Capitol Visitor Center (CVC). By meeting congressional dining needs during workdays that frequently can be unpredictable, the restaurant systems help facilitate the legislative and representational work of Congress. Because many Members and staff visit these restaurants every day, they remain a subject of ongoing congressional interest. Since 1994, the House restaurants have been operated by a private vendor, with oversight provided by the House. Under the Rules of the House of Representatives, the House restaurants fall under the jurisdiction of the Committee on House Administration, which delegates much of the daily oversight and financial management of the restaurant system to the Chief Administrative Officer (CAO) of the House. On June 9, 2015, the CAO announced that Sodexo Government Services would be the new food service provider for the House. The contract with Sodexo is for an initial term of four years. Starting in 2019, six two-year options may extend the contract for up to 12 additional years. The CAO encouraged ideas from vendors to improve operations in the Members' dining room and also initiated service schedule changes. Food service providers would not be required to operate the Members' dining room when late votes were scheduled in the evenings, on weekends, or on holidays, and instead the room would be available for hosting catered events.

    "crs_RS22389": "The low-income housing tax credit (LIHTC) was created by the Tax Reform Act of 1986 (P.L. 99-514) to provide an incentive for the development and rehabilitation of affordable rental housing. These federal housing tax credits are awarded to developers of qualified projects via a competitive application process administered by state housing finance authorities (HFAs). Developers either use the credits or sell them to investors to raise capital for real estate projects, which, in turn, reduces the debt or equity contribution that would otherwise be required of developers. With lower financing costs, tax credit properties can potentially expand the supply of affordable rental housing. The LIHTC is estimated to cost the government an average of $9.9 billion annually. Two types of LIHTCs are available depending on the nature of the construction project. The so-called 9% credit is generally reserved for new construction, while the so-called 4% credit is typically used for rehabilitation projects and new construction that is financed with tax-exempt bonds. Each year, for 10 years, a tax credit equal to roughly 4% or 9% of a project's qualified basis (cost of construction) is claimed. The applicable credit rates have historically not actually been 4% and 9%. Instead, the credit rates have fluctuated in response to market interest movements so that the program has delivered a subsidy equal to 30% of the present value of a project's qualified basis in the case of the 4% credit, and 70% in the case of the 9% credit. For both the 4% and 9% credit it is the subsidy levels (30% or 70%) that are explicitly specified in the Internal Revenue Code (IRC), not the credit rates. Since 1986, the 4% rate has ranged between 3.15% and 3.97%, and the 9% credit between 7.35% and 9.27%. Since 2008, however, there has been a floor under the 9% credit below which the new construction credit rate cannot fall. The process of allocating, awarding, and then claiming the LIHTC is complex and lengthy. The process begins at the federal level with each state receiving an annual LIHTC allocation in accordance with federal law. State housing agencies then allocate credits to developers of rental housing according to federally required, but state created, allocation plans. The process typically ends with developers selling allocated credits to outside investors in exchange for equity.",

Although only a handful of these mandatory minimum offenses are prosecuted with any regularity, drug trafficking offenses accounted for over two-thirds of the total. Congress has created three procedures that make punishment for these offenses a little less mandatory. One, the so-called safety valve (18 U.S.C.  3553(f)), permits a sentencing court to disregard a statutory minimum sentence for the benefit of a low-level, nonviolent, cooperative defendant with a minimal prior criminal record, convicted under several mandatory minimum controlled substance offenses. The other two, 18 U.S.C.  3553(e) and Rule 35(b) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, afford a sentencing court comparable latitude but only on the motion of the prosecutor, based on the defendant's substantial assistance to the government, and without regard to the offense charged. In October 2009, Congress instructed the U.S. Sentencing Commission to prepare a report on the mandatory minimum sentencing provisions under federal law. In early 2010, the commission conducted a survey of federal district court judges regarding their views on mandatory minimum sentencing. A majority of those responding endorsed amendments to the safety valve and substantial assistance exceptions. The commission also held a public hearing at which several witnesses urged adjustments in the safety valve and substantial assistance provisions. The commission subsequently recommended that Congress consider expanding the safety valve to cover other offenses and to reach offenders with slightly more extensive prior criminal records. The First Step Act authorized safety-valve relief for convictions under the Maritime Drug Enforcement Act and for defendants with slightly more extensive prior criminal records. Three provisions authorize federal courts to reduce a defendant's sentence on the motion of the government for substantial assistance: Rule 35(b) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, 18 U.S.C.  3553(e), and Section 5K1.1 of the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines. Only Section 3553(e) and Rule 35(b) are limited to mandatory minimums established for controlled substance offenses.

Despite the priority the Trump Administration has placed on reducing bilateral trade deficits in general, and with China in particular, according to official U.S. trade statistics, the overall U.S. merchandise trade deficit and the bilateral deficit with China increased in 2017 and 2018. The overall deficit rose from $736.6 billion in 2016 to $795.7 billion in 2017, and $878.7 billion in 2018. The bilateral deficit with China accounted for 47.1%, 47.2%, and 47.7% of the total merchandise trade deficit for the last three years, respectively. Debate over this trade deficit is hampered by disagreement between the two countries on how large the deficit actually is. According to official U.S. figures, China has surpassed Canada as the largest supplier of U.S. imports, running up a bilateral merchandise trade surplus in 2018 of $419.2 billion. However, according to official Chinese figures, China's trade surplus with the United States in 2018 was $323.9 billion\u2014$95.9 billion less than the U.S. figure. The U",
    "crs_RS21232": "The Bureau of Land Management (BLM, Department of the Interior) and the Forest Service (FS, Department of Agriculture) charge a grazing fee of $1.35 per animal unit month (AUM) for grazing on federal lands. The fee is to represent the fair market value of grazing, beginning with a 1966 base value of $1.23 per AUM. The fee is adjusted for three factors based on costs in western states of (1) the rental charge for pasturing cattle on private rangelands, (2) the sales price of beef cattle, and (3) the cost of livestock production. Congress also established that the annual fee adjustment could not exceed 25% of the previous year's fee. President Reagan issued Executive Order 12548 (February 14, 1986) to continue indefinitely the Public Rangelands Improvement Act of 1978 (PRIA) fee formula, and established the minimum fee of $1.35 per AUM. The fee has ranged from $1.35 per AUM (for about half of the years during the 39-year period) to $2.31 per AUM (for 1981). The fee averaged $1.55 per AUM over the period. There is ongoing debate about the appropriate grazing fee, with several key areas of contention. First, there are differences over which criteria should prevail in setting fees: fair market value; cost recovery (whereby the monies collected would cover the government's cost of running the program); sustaining ranching, or resource-based rural economies generally; or diversification of local economies. Second, there is disagreement over the validity of fair market value estimates for federal grazing because federal and private lands for leasing are not always directly comparable. Third, there are diverse views on the environmental costs and benefits of grazing on federal lands and on the environmental impact of changes in grazing levels. Fifth, it is uncertain whether fee increases would reduce the number of cattle grazing on sensitive lands, such as riparian areas. Sixth, some environmentalists assert that the fee is not the main issue, but that all livestock grazing should be barred to protect federal lands. There has been efforts to end livestock grazing on certain federal lands through voluntary retirement of permits and leases and subsequent closure of the allotments to grazing. This practice is supported by those who view grazing as damaging to the environment, more costly than beneficial, and difficult to",

    "crs_R43389": "The Constitution grants Congress the power to borrow money on the credit of the United States\u2014one part of its power of the purse\u2014and thus mandates that Congress exercise control over federal debt. The statutory debt limit applies to almost all federal debt. The limit applies to federal debt held by the public (that is, debt held outside the federal government itself) and to federal debt held by the government's own accounts. Federal trust funds, such as Social Security, Medicare, Transportation, and Civil Service Retirement accounts, hold most of this internally held debt. For most federal trust funds, net inflows by law must be invested in special federal government securities. When holdings of those trust funds increase, federal debt subject to limit will therefore increase as well. The U.S. Treasury is thus left with minimal headroom under the debt limit after a suspension ends, leaving only a cash balance similar to that when the suspension began. Therefore, the Treasury Secretary typically invokes a set of extraordinary measures, which are special strategies to handle cash and debt management. Actions taken in the past include suspending sales of nonmarketable debt, postponing or downsizing marketable debt auctions, and withholding receipts that would be transferred to certain government trust funds. In particular, extraordinary strategies include suspending investments in Civil Service Retirement and Disability Fund (CSRDF) and the G-Fund of the Federal Employees' Retirement System (FERS), as well as redeeming a limited amount of CSRDF securities. The Treasury Secretary is also mandated to make those funds whole after the resolution of a debt limit episode. The most recent debt limit suspension lapsed on March 1, 2019. The limit was then reset at $21.988 trillion, a level that accommodates federal obligations incurred during the suspension period. On March 4, 2019, the first business day after the debt limit suspension had lapsed, U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin invoked extraordinary authorities. Those extraordinary measures, along with cash balances and incoming revenues, can be used to meet federal obligations in coming months. In anticipation of the lapse of the debt limit suspension, the U.S. Treasury had announced it would stop issuing state and local government securities (SLGs) on March 1, 2019. SLGs are used by state and local governments as one way of complying with Internal Revenue Service (IRS) anti-arbitrage rules. Issu",

Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act (42 U.S.C. 5721 et seq.) authorizes the President to issue two types of declarations that could potentially provide federal assistance to states and localities in response to a terrorist attack: a \"major disaster declaration\" or an \"emergency declaration.\" Major disaster declarations authorize a wide-range of federal assistance to states, local governments, tribal nations, individuals and households, and certain nonprofit organizations to aid recovery from a catastrophic event. Major disaster declarations must be requested by the state governor or tribal leader. Emergency declarations authorize a more limited range of federal assistance and are issued by the President to protect property and public health and safety and to lessen or avert the threat of a major disaster. In most cases, the state governor or tribal leader must request an emergency declaration; however, under 501(b) of the Stafford Act, the President has authority to issue an emergency declaration without a gubernatorial or tribal request under specified conditions. Examples of these types of emergency declarations with respect to terrorist incidents include the April 19, 1995, bombing of the Alfred P. Murrah Building in Oklahoma City, and the September 11, 2001, attack on the Pentagon. In each instance, the emergency declaration was followed by a major disaster declaration. While the Stafford Act has been used to provide assistance in response to terrorist attacks in the past, recent incidents such as the mass shootings that occurred in 2015 and 2016 in San Bernardino, CA, and Orlando, FL, respectively, and the 2016 vehicular attacks in Nice, France, and Ohio State University may have brought to light some potential shortcomings in the Stafford Act. That is, certain terror incidents may not meet the criteria of a major disaster for two reasons. First, depending on the mechanism used in the attack, certain terror incidents may not meet the legal definition of a major disaster. Of interest here, the Stafford Act defines a major disaster as \"any natural catastrophe (including any hurricane, tornado, storm, high water, wind-driven water, tidal wave, tsunami, earthquake, volcanic eruption, landslide, mudslide, snowstorm, or drought), or, regardless of cause, any fire, flood, or explosion, in any part of the United States, which in the determination of the President causes damage of sufficient severity and magnitude",

According to the National Center for Historical Memory 2013 report, presented to the Colombian government as part of the peace process to end the fighting, some 220,000 Colombians died in the armed conflict through 2012, 81% of them civilians. The report also provided statistics quantifying the scale of the conflict, which has taken a huge toll on Colombian society: more than 23,000 selective assassinations between 1981 and 2012; internal displacement of more than 5 million Colombians due to land seizure and violence; 27,000 kidnappings between 1970 and 2010; and 11,000 deaths or amputees from anti-personnel land mines laid primarily by Colombia's main insurgent guerrilla group, the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC). To date, more than 8 million Colombians, or roughly 15% of the population, have registered as conflict victims. Although the violence has scarred Colombia, the country has achieved a significant turnaround. Once considered a likely candidate to become a failed state, Colombia, over the past two decades, has overcome much of the violence that had clouded its future. For example, between 2000 and 2016, Colombia saw a 94% decrease in kidnappings and a 53% reduction in homicides (below 25 per 100,000 in 2016). Coupled with success in lowering violence, Colombia has opened its economy and promoted trade, investment, and growth. Colombia has become one of Latin America's most attractive locations for foreign direct investment. Yet, after steady growth over several years, Colombia's economy slowed to 3.1% growth in 2015 and declined to 1.7% in 2017. Many analysts identified Colombia's dependence on oil and other commodity exports as the primary cause. Between 2012 and 2016, the Colombian government held formal peace talks with the FARC, Colombia's largest guerrilla organization.

While some request asylum at U.S. ports of entry, others do so after attempting to enter the United States illegally between U.S. ports of entry. On May 7, 2018, then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions announced that the Department of Justice (DOJ) implemented a \"zero tolerance\" policy toward illegal border crossing, both to discourage illegal migration into the United States and to reduce the burden of processing asylum claims that Administration officials contend are often fraudulent. Under the zero tolerance policy, DOJ prosecuted 100% of adult aliens apprehended crossing the border illegally, making no exceptions for whether they were asylum seekers or accompanied by minor children. Illegal border crossing is a misdemeanor for a first time offender and a felony for anyone who has previously been \"denied admission, excluded, deported, or removed, or has departed the United States while an order of exclusion, deportation or removal is outstanding and thereafter enters, attempts to enter or is found in the U.S.\" Both such criminal offenses can be prosecuted by DOJ in federal criminal courts. DOJ's \"100% prosecution\" policy represented a change in the level of enforcement of an existing statute rather than a change in statute or regulation. The recent Bush and Obama Administrations prosecuted illegal border crossings relatively infrequently, in part to avoid having DOJ resources committed to prosecuting sizeable numbers of misdemeanors. At different times during those Administrations, illegal entrants would be criminally prosecuted in an attempt to reduce illegal migration, but exceptions were generally made for families and asylum seekers. Illegal border crossers who are prosecuted by DOJ are detained in federal criminal facilities. Because children are not permitted in criminal detention facilities with adults, detaining adults who crossed illegally requires that any minor children under age 18 accompanying them be treated as unaccompanied alien children (UAC) and transferred to the care and custody of the Department of Health and Human Services' (HHS's) Office of Refugee Resettlement (ORR).

Investigating and judging Members of Congress continues to be an issue for Congress. In 1964, the Senate established the Select Committee on Ethics, and in 1967, the House created the Committee on Standards of Official Conduct, which was renamed the Committee on Ethics in the 112th Congress (2011-2012). These two committees formally assumed the duties of investigating allegations of wrongdoing against Members of their respective chambers. In the House, the Committee on Ethics has had sole responsibility to investigate and recommend the discipline of Members. Self-discipline by the Committee on Ethics has, at various times, been considered problematic, as Members are dependent on one another to do their jobs, bring individual perspectives on chamber rules to investigations, and are judged by the public at the same time they are judging congressional colleagues. This creates a difficult investigative environment and often leads to closed-door investigations and media allegations of improper enforcement of chamber rules. Historically, Congress has used its ethics power neither arbitrarily nor frequently. Congress has, however, \"periodically tightened its ethics codes and procedures for dealing with misconduct.\" In addition to amending internal congressional ethics codes and procedures, Congress has considered numerous legislative proposals since 1951 to create an independent ethics advisory body that would replace or assist the Committee on Ethics with investigations or enforcement. In the 110th Congress (2007-2008), the House created the Office of Congressional Ethics (OCE) to review complaints, and when appropriate, refer findings of fact to the Committee on Ethics. The OCE is the first independent, outside body charged by Congress to investigate complaints against Members and refer valid complaints to the Committee on Ethics. The OCE is intended to perform an important public service for the House and the public by assuring the integrity of the chamber.

Ozone has also been linked to plant damage and decreases in crop yield. Concentrations of ozone at the ground level, originally considered a local issue, is increasingly recognized as a global challenge. Ozone is not emitted directly but is formed in the atmosphere from chemical reactions of nitrogen oxides (NOx) with volatile organic compounds (VOCs, a type of hydrocarbon) in the presence of sunlight.

Benefit payments and related administrative expenses are paid out of the Black Lung Disability Trust Fund. The primary source of revenue for the trust fund is an excise tax on coal produced and sold domestically. If excise tax revenue is not sufficient to finance Black Lung Program benefits, the trust fund may borrow from the general fund of the Treasury, which contains federal receipts not earmarked for a specific purpose. For 2018, the tax rates on coal were $1.10 per ton of underground-mined coal or $0.55 per ton of surface-mined coal, limited to 4.4% of the sales price. Starting in 2019, under current law, these tax rates are $0.50 per ton of underground-mined coal or $0.25 per ton of surface-mined coal, limited to 2% of the sales price. This decline in the excise tax rates will likely put additional financial strain on a trust fund that already borrows from the general fund to meet obligations. The decline in domestic coal production, recent increases in the rate of CWP, and bankruptcies in the coal sector also contribute to the financial strain on the trust fund. There are various policy options that Congress might consider to improve the fiscal condition of the Black Lung Disability Trust Fund. Broadly, increasing taxes on the coal industry (or maintaining 2018 rates) would pass the costs associated with paying black lung benefits onto the coal industry. Alternatively, forgiving trust fund interest or debt or financing black lung benefits out of general fund revenues would pass the costs of federal black lung benefits onto taxpayers in general.

Business loan credit subsidies represent the net present value of cash flows to and from the SBA over the life of the agency's loan portfolios. For guaranteed loans, the net present value of cash flows is affected by several factors, but it is primarily the difference between the cost of purchasing loans that have defaulted and the revenue generated from fees and collateral liquidation.

Some analysts maintain that chronic corruption diminishes support for democracy and stokes cynicism about the integrity of politics. However, 2018 saw prominent anti-corruption candidates and campaigns win elections across the region, with populist and anti-establishment fervor marking campaigns in Mexico, Brazil, and several other countries. In these contests, leading candidates abandoned traditional parties sullied by corruption allegations. For instance, in Mexico, the decades-long dominance of the Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI)\u2014displaced in 2000, but resurgent in 2012\u2014was again swept out in Mexico's July 2018 national elections by the National Regeneration Party, or MORENA, founded four years earlier. Throughout the region, winning candidates of the left and the right\u2014as in Mexico and Brazil\u2014embraced anti-establishment platforms that appealed to voter disillusionment with corrupt elites. In its global perceptions survey, Transparency International (TI) has found that a majority of Latin Americans tend to believe pervasive public corruption exists and is expanding its reach. The sense of widespread corruption may be sparking a civil society rejection of the status quo and a deeper commitment to combat corrupt behavior and demand accountability.

In recent years, Congress has passed laws to create and improve systems used by government departments and agencies to report and input data on federal awards for contracts, grants, and other financial assistance: P.L. 109-282, the Federal Funding Accountability and Transparency Act of 2006 (FFATA), called for the creation of a database that became USAspending.gov. The publicly available database replaced data collection and annual reports issued for more than 30 years in the Census Bureau's Federal Aid to States (FAS) report and Consolidated Federal Funds Report (CFFR). P.L. 111-5, the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (ARRA), required federal agencies awarding stimulus funding and state and local recipients of such funding to report spending back to the ARRA Recovery Board; this reporting also became a part of USAspending.gov. P.L. 113-101, the Digital Accountability and Transparency Act of 2014 (DATA Act), transferred responsibility for USAspending.gov from the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) to the Department of the Treasury and required that expenditures data be added to the federal agency obligations data already included in the USAspending.gov database.

For example, it provides education programs to assist with business formation and expansion; loan guaranty programs to enhance small business owners' access to capital; and programs to increase small business opportunities in federal contracting, including oversight of the service-disabled veteran-owned small business federal procurement goaling program. The SBA also provides direct loans for owners of businesses of all sizes, homeowners, and renters to assist their recovery from natural disasters. The Military Reservist Economic Injury Disaster Loan (MREIDL) program is also of interest to veterans. It provides direct loans of up to $2 million to small business owners who are not able to obtain credit elsewhere meet ordinary and necessary operating expenses that they could have met but are not able to because an essential employee has been called up to active duty in his or her role as a military reservist or member of the National Guard due to a period of military conflict. The SBA provides management and technical assistance to more than 100,000 veterans each year through its various training partners (e.g., Small Business Development Centers, Women's Business Centers, SCORE [formerly the Service Corps of Retired Executives], and Veterans Business Outreach Centers [VBOCs]). In addition, the SBA's Office of Veterans Business Development (OVBD) administers several programs to assist veteran-owned small businesses. The SBA's OVBD received an appropriation of $12.7 million for FY2018. The SBA has always assisted veteran small business owners and aspiring veteran entrepreneurs. In recent years, they have focused increased attention on assisting veterans transition from the military to the civilian labor force. For example, the SBA's OVBD, in partnership with Syracuse University, launched the Operation Boots to Business: From Service to Startup initiative for transitioning servicemembers in July 2012. The initiative consists of a two-day introductory course on entrepreneurship followed by an eight-week, online course to prepare servicemenmbers and military spouses \"for post-service career success as business owners.\" Congress provided the SBA's OVBD an additional $7 million in FY2014 to expand the Boots to Business initiative \"nationwide to the 250,000 yearly transitioning servicemembers in all branches of the military.\" In FY2017, 17,320",

As an economist explained growing firms need resources, but many small firms may have a hard time obtaining loans because they are young and have little credit history. Lenders may also be reluctant to lend to small firms with innovative products because it might be difficult to collect enough reliable information to correctly estimate the risk for such products. If it's true that the lending process leaves worthy projects unfunded, some suggest that it would be good to fix this \"market failure\" with government programs aimed at improving small businesses' access to credit. Congressional interest in the SBA's access to capital programs has increased in recent years, primarily because assisting small business in accessing capital is viewed as a means to enhance job creation and economic growth. Some have argued that the SBA should be provided additional resources to assist small businesses in acquiring capital necessary to start, continue, or expand operations and create jobs. Others worry about the long-term adverse economic effects of spending programs that increase the federal deficit. They advocate business tax reduction, reform of financial credit market regulation, and federal fiscal restraint as the best means to assist small business economic growth and job creation. They also point to surveys of small business firms conducted by the National Federation of Independent Business (NFIB) which suggest that small business owners consistently place financing issues near the bottom of their most pressing concerns.

Congress passed the FY2018 Consolidated Appropriations Act on March 23, 2018 (P.L. 115-141). FY2019 began with seven appropriations bills, including USDA, unfinished. The House and Senate Appropriations Committees reported Agriculture appropriations bills for FY2019 (H.R. 5961, S. 2976), with the Senate having amended and passed its version as Division C of a four-bill minibus (H.R. 6147). Congress and the President approved continuing resolutions to fund the affected federal agencies through December 21, 2018, at the FY2018 level (P.L. 115-245 and P.L. 115-298). After December 21, 2018, a partial shutdown of the government, including many agencies within USDA, occurred. One of the few exceptions was the Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS), which was able to operate on mandatory and carryover funds during the majority of the shutdown. On January 25, 2019, an agreement was reached to continue funding for USDA and other appropriations that had lapsed through February 15, at the FY2018 level (P.L. 116-5). The FY2019 Consolidated Appropriations Act was signed into law on February 15, 2019, funding USDA through the end of the fiscal year (Division B, P.L. 116-6).

These three trade-related agencies are funded through the annual Commerce, Justice, Science, and Related Agencies (CJS) appropriations. This report also provides a review of these trade agencies' programs. When comparing the Administration's FY2019 request with FY2018 funding, one may want to consider that the Administration formulated its FY2019 budget request before full-year appropriations for FY2018 were enacted. In this report, FY2018 funding levels reflect the amounts appropriated in the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2018 (P.L. 115-141), enacted on March 23, 2018. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2018 provided $482.0 million in direct funding for ITA, $93.7 million for USTIC, and a total of $72.6 million for USTR for FY2018. The FY2018 appropriation for the three CJS trade-related agencies totaled $648.3 million. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2019, provided $484.0 million in direct appropriations for ITA, $95.0 million in funding for USITC, and a total of $68.0 million for USTR. The FY2019 appropriations for three CJS trade-related agencies totaled $647.0 million, a 0.2% decrease from FY2018 appropriations. The House and Senate Appropriations Committees reported their CJS appropriation bills in the spring of 2018. Both committees largely declined the budget cuts requested by the Administration for these three trade agencies. The House Committee on Appropriations reported H.R. 5952 on May 17, 2018.

    "crs_R43792": "The Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA), enacted in 1938, is the federal legislation that establishes the general minimum wage that must be paid to all covered workers. The FLSA mandates broad minimum wage coverage. It also specifies certain categories of workers who are not covered by general FLSA wage standards, such as workers with disabilities or certain youth workers. In 1938, the FLSA established a minimum wage of $0.25 per hour. The minimum wage provisions of the FLSA have been amended numerous times since then, typically to expand coverage or raise the wage rate. Since its establishment, the minimum wage rate has been raised 22 separate times. The most recent change was enacted through P.L. 110-28 in 2007, which increased the minimum wage from $5.15 per hour to its current rate of $7.25 per hour in three steps (the final step occurring in 2009). States generally have three options in setting their minimum wage policies: (1) they can set their own minimum wage provisions that differ from those in the FLSA, (2) they can explicitly tie their minimum wage provisions to the FLSA, or (3) they can include no specific minimum wage provisions in state law. In 2019, the range of state minimum wage rates is as follows: 29 states and the District of Columbia have enacted minimum wage rates above the federal rate of $7.25 per hour; 2 states have minimum wage rates below the federal rate; 5 states have no state minimum wage requirement; and the remaining 14 states have minimum wage rates equal to the federal rate. In the states with no minimum wage requirements or wages lower than the federal minimum wage, only individuals who are not covered by the FLSA are subject to those lower rates. In any given year, the exact number of states with a minimum wage rate above the federal rate may vary, depending on what mechanism is in place to adjust the state minimum wage. Some states specifically set rates above the federal rate. Other states have rates above the federal minimum wage because the state minimum wage rate is indexed to a measure of inflation or is increased in legislatively scheduled increments, and thus the state rate changes even if the federal minimum wage stays unchanged. In the 29 states and the District of Columbia with minimum wage rates above the federal rate in 2019, minimum hourly rates range from $7.50 per hour in New Mexico to $12.00 per hour in Massachusetts and Washington and $14.00 in the District of Columbia.

Although some youth today also leave home due to abuse and neglect, they often endure far more negative outcomes than their romanticized counterparts from an earlier era. Without adequate and safe shelter, runaway and homeless youth are vulnerable to engaging in high-risk behaviors and further victimization. Youth who live away from home for extended periods may become removed from school and systems of support. Runaway and homeless youth are vulnerable to multiple problems while they are away from a permanent home, including untreated mental health disorders, drug use, and sexual exploitation. They also report other challenges including poor health and the lack of basic provisions. Congress began to hear concerns about the vulnerabilities of the runaway population in the 1970s due to increased awareness about these youth and the establishment of runaway shelters to assist them in returning home. Congress and the President went on to enact the Runaway Youth Act of 1974 as Title III of the Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention Act (P.L. 93-415) to assist runaways through services specifically for this population. Since that time, the law has been updated to authorize services to provide support for runaway and homeless youth outside of the juvenile justice, mental health, and child welfare systems. The Runaway and Homeless Youth Act\u2014now known as the Runaway and Homeless Youth Act\u2014authorized federal funding to be provided through annual appropriations for three programs that assist runaway and homeless youth: the Basic Center Program (BCP), Transitional Living Program (TLP), and Street Outreach Program (SOP). Together, the programs make up the Runaway and Homeless Youth Program (RHYP), administered by the Family and Youth Services Bureau (FYSB) in the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services' (HHS) Administration for Children and Families (ACF). The Basic Center Program provides funding to community-based organizations for crisis intervention, temporary shelter, counseling, family unification, and after care services to runaway and homeless youth under age 18 and their families.

Direct support can often involve the transfer of billions of dollars each year. For example, USDA's Commodity Credit Corporation (CCC) outlays on farm support programs have averaged $13.7 billion per year from 1996 through 2017. Program payments vary across commodities and regions as well as by size of farm operations. This variation has generated considerable interest\u2014by both the general public and Congress\u2014in who is eligible to participate in farm programs and, thus, may receive payments. The concern over program eligibility also derives, in part, from instances where farm payments have accrued to individuals who have never engaged in farming. Program eligibility requirements and payment limits are central to how many U.S. farm programs operate and how support dollars are distributed across the nation. In particular, eligibility requirements and payment limits determine who receives federal farm program payments and how much they receive. A number of statutory and regulatory requirements govern federal farm program eligibility for benefits under various programs. A key aspect of eligibility for major farm revenue support programs is the requirement that a person be \"actively engaged in farming\" (AEF)\u2014that is, that a person contribute either labor or management time (or both) to the farm's operation. Not all farm programs are subject to the same AEF criteria, and the criteria often apply differently based on the type of legal entity owning the farm operation.

Prior examples include committees tasked with studying a wide spectrum of issues, including both budget process\u2014such as the Joint Committee to Study Budget Control (created by P.L. 92-599)\u2014and other topics, such as the Senate Select Committee to Study Governmental Operations with Respect to Intelligence Activities (also known as the Church Committee after its chairman, Senator Frank Church, created by S.Res. 2, 94th Congress). The act directed the joint select committee to \"provide recommendations and legislative language that will significantly reform the budget and appropriations process.\" The act also required the committee to hold its first meeting not later than 30 calendar days after the date of enactment, with the cochairs of the committee required to provide an agenda to committee members at least 48 hours in advance of any meeting. The initial organizing meeting was held on March 7, 2018, with additional working group meetings held on August 22, September 13, and September 26, 2018, and a markup held on November 15, 27, and 29, 2018. The committee was also authorized and expected to hold hearings and take testimony from witnesses. Each cochair was entitled to select an equal number of witnesses for each hearing. Witnesses appearing before the committee were required to file a written statement of proposed testimony at least two calendar days before his or her appearance.

Expansionary fiscal policy\u2014an increase in government spending, a decrease in tax revenue, or a combination of the two\u2014is expected to spur economic activity, whereas contractionary fiscal policy\u2014a decrease in government spending, an increase in tax revenue, or a combination of the two\u2014is expected to slow economic activity.

From a policymaker's perspective, expansionary fiscal policy is generally used to boost GDP growth and the economic indicators that tend to move with GDP, such as employment and individual incomes. However, expansionary fiscal policy also tends to affect interest rates and investment, exchange rates and the trade balance, and the inflation rate in undesirable ways, limiting the long-term effectiveness of persistent fiscal stimulus. Contractionary fiscal policy can be used to slow economic activity if policymakers are concerned that the economy may be overheating, which can cause a recession.

Insurance is often seen as a localized product and U.S. insurance regulation has addressed this through a state-centric regulatory system. The McCarran-Ferguson Act, passed by Congress in 1945, gives primacy to the individual states, and every state has its own insurance regulator and state laws governing insurance. Although the risks of loss and the regulation may be local, the business of insurance, as with many financial services, has an increasingly substantial international component as companies look to grow and diversify. The international aspects of insurance have spurred the creation of a variety of entities and measures, both domestic and foreign, to facilitate the trade and regulation of insurance services. Financial services have been addressed in a number of U.S. trade agreements going back to the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) in 1994. The International Association of Insurance Supervisors (IAIS) was created more than 20 years ago, largely under the impetus of the U.S. National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC), to promote cooperation and exchange of information among insurance supervisors, including development of regulatory standards. The 2007-2009 financial crisis sparked further international developments, with heads of state of the G-20 nations creating the Financial Stability Board (FSB). The postcrisis 2010 Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Dodd-Frank) altered the U.S. insurance regulatory system, particularly as it relates to international issues. With the states continuing as the primary insurance regulators, following Dodd-Frank, the Federal Reserve exercised holding company oversight over insurers who owned a bank subsidiary or who were designated for enhanced supervision (popularly known as systemically important financial institutions or SIFIs) by the new Financial Stability Oversight Council (FSOC).

The majority of OAA grant funds are provided to states and other entities based on statutory formulas that exist in the following titles: Title III, Grants for State and Community Programs on Aging; Title V, Community Service Employment for Older Americans; Title VI, Grants for Older Native Americans; and Title VII, Vulnerable Elder Rights Protection Activities. These formula grants fund programs that assist older Americans with supportive services in their homes; congregate nutrition services (meals served at group sites such as senior centers, community centers, schools, churches, or senior housing complexes); home-delivered nutrition services; family caregiver support; community service employment; the long-term care ombudsman program; and services to prevent the abuse, neglect, and exploitation of older persons. The OAA also supports grants to older Native Americans for nutrition and supportive services. Since enactment of OAA, Congress has reauthorized and amended the act numerous times. Most recently, the Older Americans Act Reauthorization Act of 2016 (P.L. 114-144) authorized appropriations for OAA programs for FY2017 through FY2019, and made other changes to the act, including changes to four Title III programs that receive funding under statutory formulas.

They can be delivered by aircraft or from ground systems such as artillery, rockets, and missiles. Cluster munitions are valued militarily because one munition can kill or destroy many targets within its impact area, and fewer weapons systems are needed to deliver fewer munitions to attack multiple targets. Cluster munitions also permit a smaller force to engage a larger adversary and are considered by some an \"economy of force\" weapon. Many cluster munitions rely on simple mechanical fuzes that arm the submunition based on its rate of spin and explode on impact or after a time delay. A newer generation of sensor-fuzed submunitions is being introduced by a number of nations to improve the munitions' and submunitions' accuracy and to reduce the large number of residual unexploded submunitions. These sensor-fuzed submunitions are designed to sense and destroy vehicles without creating an extensive hazard area of unexploded submunitions. The fundamental criticisms of cluster munitions are that they disperse large numbers of submunitions imprecisely over an extended area, that they frequently fail to detonate and are difficult to detect, and that submunitions can remain explosive hazards for decades. Civilian casualties are primarily caused by munitions being fired into areas where soldiers and civilians are intermixed, inaccurate cluster munitions landing in populated areas, or civilians traversing areas where cluster munitions have been employed but failed to explode.

    "crs_R44891": "The U.S. role in the world since World War II has been generally described as one of global leadership and significant engagement in international affairs. Observers over the years have referred to the U.S. role in the world using various terms and phrases that sometimes reflect varying degrees of approval or disapproval of that role. It has been variously described as that of global leader, leader of the free world, superpower, hyperpower, indispensable power, system administrator, world policeman, or world hegemon. Similarly, the United States has also been described as pursuing an internationalist foreign policy, a foreign policy of global engagement or deep engagement, a foreign policy that provides global public goods, a foreign policy of liberal order building, liberal internationalism, or liberal hegemony, an interventionist foreign policy, or a foreign policy of seeking primacy or world hegemony. The fact that the U.S. role in the world has been generally stable over the past 70 years does not necessarily mean that this role was the right one for the United States, or that it would be the right one in the future. Although the role the United States has played in the world since the end of World War II has many defenders, it also has critics, and the merits of that role have been a matter of long-standing debate among foreign policy specialists, strategists, policymakers, and the public, with critics offering potential alternative concepts for the U.S. role in the world. One major dimension of the debate is whether the United States should attempt to continue playing the active internationalist role that it has played for the past 70 years, or instead adopt a more-restrained role that reduces U.S. involvement in world affairs. A number of critics of the U.S. role in the world over the past 70 years have offered multiple variations on the idea of a more-restrained U.S. role. A second major dimension within the debate over the future U.S. role concerns how to balance or combine the pursuit of narrowly defined material U.S. interests with the goal of defending and promoting U.S. or universal values such as democracy, freedom, and human rights. A third major dimension concerns the balance in U.S. foreign policy between the use of hard power and soft power. Observers debating these two dimensions of the future U",

The largest are the National School Lunch Program (NSLP) and School Breakfast Program (SBP), which subsidize free, reduced-price, and full-price meals in participating schools. Also operating in schools, the Fresh Fruit and Vegetable Program provides funding for fruit and vegetable snacks in participating elementary schools, and the Special Milk Program provides support for milk in schools that do not participate in NSLP or SBP. Other child nutrition programs include the Child and Adult Care Food Program, which provides meals and snacks in child care and after-school settings, and the Summer Food Service Program, which provides food during the summer months. The child nutrition programs were last reauthorized by the Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act of 2010 (HHFKA, P.L. 111-296). On September 30, 2015, some of the authorities created or extended by the HHFKA expired. However, these expirations had a minimal impact on program operations, as the child nutrition programs have continued with funding provided by annual appropriations acts. In the 114th Congress, lawmakers began but did not complete child nutrition reauthorization, which refers to the process of reauthorizing and potentially making changes to multiple permanent statutes\u2014the Richard B. Russell National School Lunch Act, the Child Nutrition Act, and sometimes Section 32 of the Act of August 24, 1935. Both committees of jurisdiction\u2014the Senate Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry and the House Committee on Education and the Workforce\u2014reported reauthorization legislation (S. 3136 and H.R. 5003), respectively. This legislation died at the end of the 114th Congress, as is the case for any bill that has not yet passed both chambers and been sent to the President at the end of a Congress. There were no significant child nutrition reauthorization efforts in the 115th Congress; however, 2018 farm bill proposals and the final enacted bill included a few provisions related to child nutrition programs.

    "crs_R43823": "Since its inception in 2006, the National Popular Vote (NPV) initiative has promoted an agreement among the states, an interstate compact that would effectively establish direct popular election of the President and Vice President without a constitutional amendment, while retaining the structure of the electoral college system. The United States is unique among \"presidential\" republics by providing an indirect election to choose its chief executive. The President and Vice President of the United States are selected not by registered voters, but by the electoral college, electors appointed in the states \"in such Manner as the Legislature thereof may direct.... \" This grant of authority provides the constitutional basis claimed for the NPV initiative. In practice, all states currently provide for popular election of their electoral college delegations. Candidates for the office of elector are nominated by political parties and other groups on the presidential ballot in each state. In most cases, the candidates for the office of elector are nominated by the state party committee or the party's statewide convention. The winning presidential nominees must gain a national majority of 270 or more electoral votes, out of the 538 total, in order to be elected. If no ticket of candidates attains a majority, then the House of Representatives elects the President, and the Senate the Vice President, in a procedure known as contingent election. Candidates for the office of elector are selected by their respective political parties. They are expected to vote for the presidential and vice presidential candidates to whom they are pledged. Some states seek to require them to so vote by law or other means, but most constitutional scholars hold that the electors remain free agents under the Constitution, and that they may vote for any person they choose. On rare occasions an elector will vote for a different candidate, or abstain from casting a vote for any candidate; he or she is known as a \"faithless elector.\" The goal of presidential campaigns under the existing system is to win by carrying states that collectively cast a majority of electoral votes. Political parties and presidential campaigns tend to focus on states that are closely contested (widely referred to as \"battleground\" states), or that have large delegations of electoral votes, or both. Winning a majority of the more populous and/or battleground states is considered crucial to obtaining the necessary electoral vote majority. In 48 states and the District of Columbia",

These acts cover workers who are employed by railroads engaged in interstate commerce and related subsidiaries, railroad associations, and railroad labor organizations. Lifelong railroad workers receive railroad retirement benefits instead of Social Security benefits; railroad workers with nonrailroad experience receive benefits either from railroad retirement or Social Security, depending on the length of their railroad service. The number of railroad workers has been declining since the 1950s, although the rate of decline has been irregular and recent years have seen increases in railroad employment after reaching an all-time low of 215,000 workers in January 2010. Recently, railroad employment peaked in April 2015 to 253,000 workers, the highest level since November 1999, and then declined through FY2017, falling to 221,000 workers. The total number of beneficiaries under the RRA and RUIA decreased from 623,000 in FY2008 to 574,000 in FY2017, and total benefit payments increased from $10.1 billion to $12.6 billion during the same time. During FY2017, the RRB paid nearly $12.5 billion in retirement, disability, and survivor benefits to approximately 548,000 beneficiaries. Almost $105.4 million in unemployment and sickness benefits were paid to approximately 28,000 claimants.

From then until 2013, Kuwait underwent repeated political crises that produced economic stagnation. The current Prime Minister, Shaykh Jabir al-Mubarak Al Sabah, has been in office since December 2011. The Amir has been the head of state and ruler of Kuwait since 1962. He is Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces, appoints all judges, and can suspend the National Assembly. The Amir appoints a Prime Minister as head of government, who in turn appoints a cabinet. The Prime Minister has always been a member of the Sabah family, and until 2003 the Prime Minister and Crown Prince/heir apparent posts were held by a single person. It is typical of Kuwaiti cabinets that most of the key ministries (defense, foreign policy, and finance) are led by Sabah family members. At the time of Amir Jabir's death, his designated successor, Shaykh Sa'ad bin Abdullah Al Sabah, was infirm. A brief succession dispute among rival branches of the ruling Al Sabah family was resolved with then-Prime Minister Shaykh Sabah al-Ahmad al-Jabir Al Sabah, the younger brother of the late Amir, becoming Amir on January 29, 2006, although the long-standing tacit agreement to alternate succession between the Jabir and Salem branches of the family was suspended. Amir Sabah appointed two members of his Jabir branch as Crown Prince/heir apparent and as prime minister (Shaykh Nawwwaf al-Ahmad Al Sabah and Shaykh Nasser al Muhammad al-Ahmad Al Sabah respectively). The succession dispute was unprecedented for the involvement of an elected legislature in replacing a Kuwait leader. Amir Sabah tends to be more directly involved in governance than was his predecessor. He is 87 years old, but remains actively engaged in governing.

The South Caucasus also borders Iran and Turkey. Georgia's neighbors, Armenia and Azerbaijan, have been locked in territorial conflict for almost three decades over the predominantly Armenian-populated region of Nagorno-Karabakh, formally part of Azerbaijan. Georgia gained independence in 1991 with the collapse of the Soviet Union. Georgia has a unicameral legislature with 150 members elected for four-year terms by two methods: 77 by party list and 73 by majoritarian district. The most recent parliamentary elections in 2016 resulted in a sizeable win for Georgia's center-left ruling party, Georgian Dream-Democratic Georgia (GD), which initially led a ruling coalition after coming to power in 2012 and now governs alone. GD won 49% of the party list vote and nearly all majoritarian races, leading to control of more than 75% of parliamentary seats (116 of 150 deputies). Before losing this supermajority in February 2019, GD had enough votes to unilaterally enact changes to Georgia's constitution. This led many observers and opposition supporters to express concern that there were insufficient checks and balances against the ruling party. GD's main competitor in 2016 was the center-right United National Movement (UNM), the former ruling party previously led by ex-president Mikheil Saakashvili. The UNM received 27% of the party vote and 27 seats (18%). After months of infighting, the UNM fragmented in 2017, and most of its deputies, including much of the party's senior leadership, formed a new opposition party called European Georgia-Movement for Liberty. A third electoral bloc, the nationalist-conservative Alliance of Patriots of Georgia-United Opposition, cleared the 5% threshold to enter parliament with six seats. GD's most recent local elections were in 2017. They provided a similar picture of ruling party dominance across the country.

The war has exacerbated a humanitarian crisis in Yemen that began in 2011; as of January 2019, over half of the population required emergency food assistance. Access restrictions to certain areas of Yemen make it problematic for governments and aid agencies to count the war's casualties.

Consequently, the increasing volume of imports has heightened public concern about the potential for introducing pests and diseases. Most imported agricultural products, such as live animal and plants, are inspected by U.S. government officials and have accompanying documentation\u2014animal and plant health import permits\u2014certifying adherence to U.S. requirements. More than ever, the U.S. government depends on the proper use of these import permits to facilitate U.S. agricultural trade. The USDA's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) regulates the import, transit, and release of regulated animals, animal products, veterinary biologics, plants, plant products, pests, organisms, soil, and genetically engineered organisms. APHIS works with foreign exporters, U.S. importers, and foreign governments to interpret and enforce APHIS-issued animal and plant health import permits. Animal and plant health import permits include components from U.S. specific regulations and World Trade Organization (WTO) guidelines. Further, these health import permits are a part of broader agreements between the United States and its trading partners in the WTO that establish sanitary and phytosanitary (SPS) standards. SPS measures aim to protect against diseases, pests, toxins, and other contaminants.

In addition, APHIS works with the Department of Homeland Security's Customs and Border Protection (CBP), in addition to other federal agencies (e.g., Food Safety and Inspection Service, Food and Drug Administration), to enforce agricultural import regulations. CBP has authority to enforce APHIS regulations at ports of entry.

It is the only federally funded voucher program in the United States. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2004 (P.L. 108-199), which combined six appropriations bills\u2014including the FY2004 District of Columbia Appropriations Act\u2014authorized and appropriated funding for the DC OSP. The program was established under the DC School Choice Incentive Act of 2003, which was included in P.L. 108-199. Appropriations were initially authorized for FY2004 through FY2008. The program is administered by the U.S. Department of Education (ED). The FY2004 appropriations act provided funding for the DC OSP for the first time and also, for the first time, provided funding for District of Columbia Public Schools (DCPS) for the improvement of public education, and funding for the District of Columbia State Education Office (SEO) for public charter schools. This approach, commonly known as the \"three-pronged approach\" to funding elementary and secondary education in the District of Columbia, was initially suggested by Mayor Anthony Williams when he asked for federal assistance for public education in the District of Columbia. The proposal was supported by the George W. Bush Administration and many Members of Congress. While concerns were raised during consideration of the DC School Choice Incentive Act of 2003 that only the DC OSP\u2014not school improvement funding for DCPS or public charter schools\u2014was authorized for five years, the federal government has also provided funds to support school improvement in DC public schools and DC public charter schools for each year that the DC OSP has been funded. The SOAR Act was most recently comprehensively reauthorized by the SOAR Reauthorization Act (P.L. 115-31), which amended the SOAR Act and extended the authorization of appropriations for the DC OSP, DC public schools, and DC public charter schools through FY2019. Many of the provisions included in the SOAR Act continue to be reflected in current law. Changes to the DC OSP have also been made primarily through appropriations acts in the intervening fiscal years. For FY2019, $52.5 million was appropriated for the SOAR Act, with $17.5 million each provided to the DC OSP",
    "crs_R45713": "The \"vast democratic fora of the Internet\" have provided ample platforms not only for those seeking to debate issues or express controversial views, but also for individuals and entities planning violent attacks or threatening violence online. Many policymakers and commentators, including some Members of Congress, have expressed concerns about the proliferation of social media content promoting terrorism and violence and the influence such speech can have on other internet users. Some have called on Congress to restrict or even prohibit such content, which raises the question of whether the First Amendment would allow such regulation. A number of legal scholars have explored these issues, and some have proposed recommendations to Congress about how best to address these concerns in accordance with the First Amendment. Although governmental efforts to combat online content promoting terrorism or violence could take a number of forms, this report focuses on the First Amendment implications of imposing civil or criminal liability on individual internet users (i.e., the originators of the content) rather than the social media companies or internet service providers themselves. As such, it focuses on the underlying First Amendment issues that are likely to be common to both forms of government action, but does not discuss the additional considerations attendant to regulating a social media platform, which are the subject of another CRS report. The report begins with some background on the use of the internet by terrorist groups and the reported influence of online content on certain individuals accused of committing violent attacks. It then considers the question of who can invoke the First Amendment by analyzing whether its free speech protections apply to foreign nationals when they post online content from abroad, for example, in circumstances such as U.S. prosecutions where online content is introduced as evidence of a crime. The report then discusses the overarching First Amendment principles that bear on what the government may regulate under the First Amendment, including (1) the distinction between regulating conduct and speech; (2) the presumed invalidity of content-based laws; and (3) relevant \"unprotected\" categories of speech that generally can be restricted because of their content. The report next discusses the strict scrutiny standard and the overbreadth doctrine, which impose limitations on how the government can regulate by requiring that laws restricting speech be sufficiently tailored and not so broad as to chill protected speech. Finally, the report concludes with some considerations for Congress in evaluating the constitutionality of regulating online content promoting terrorism or violence.",

These groups may commonly be described as congressional caucuses, working groups, or task forces, but in this report, will be identified, collectively, as informal Member organizations, to avoid confusion with official party caucuses. An additional distinction between informal Member organizations may be drawn. In the House of Representatives, some groups may register with the Committee on House Administration to form a Congressional Member Organization (CMO). CMOs registered with the Committee on House Administration can include groups exclusively for House Members or bicameral groups that include House Members and Senators. Informal Member organizations that are not registered with the Committee on House Administration are called informal Member groups; these include groups exclusive to the Senate, which does not have any formal registration process for informal Member organizations. These distinctions are described in greater detail in the sections below. The Appendix provides some considerations for House Members seeking to form a CMO.

    "crs_R40860": "The Small Business Act of 1953 (P.L. 83-163, as amended) authorized the U.S. Small Business Administration (SBA) and justified the agency's existence on the grounds that small businesses are essential to the maintenance of the free enterprise system. In economic terms, the congressional intent was to assist small businesses as a means to deter monopoly and oligarchy formation within all industries and the market failures caused by the elimination or reduction of competition in the marketplace. Congress decided to allow the SBA to establish size standards to ensure that only small businesses were provided SBA assistance. Specifically, the Small Business Act of 1953 defines a small business as one that is organized for profit; has a place of business in the United States; operates primarily within the United States or makes a significant contribution to the U.S. economy through payment of taxes or use of American products, materials, or labor; is independently owned and operated; and is not dominant in its field on a national basis. The SBA conducts an analysis of various economic factors, such as each industry's overall competitiveness and the competitiveness of firms within each industry, in its size standards methodology. The size standards are based on four measures: (1) number of employees (505 industries), (2) average annual receipts in the previous three (may soon be the previous five) years (526 industries), (3) average asset size as reported in the firm's four quarterly financial statements for the preceding year (526 industries), or (4) a combination of number of employees and barrel per day refining capacity (1 industry). Overall, about 97% of all employer firms qualify as small. These firms represent about 30% of industry receipts. In the absence of precise statutory guidance and consensus on how to define small, the SBA's size standards have often been challenged, typically by industry representatives seeking to increase the number of firms eligible for assistance and by Members of Congress concerned that the size standards do not adequately target the SBA's assistance to firms that they consider to be truly small. The SBA's size standards have also been challenged by Members of Congress concerned that the size standards may not adequately target the SBA's assistance to firms that they consider to be truly small. The SBA's congressionally mandated requirement to conduct a detailed review of at least one-third of the SBA's industry size standards every 18 months was imposed by P.L",

Established in 1981 by Title XXVI of P.L. 97-35, the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act, LIHEAP has been reauthorized and amended a number of times, most recently in 2005, when P.L. 109-58, the Energy Policy Act, authorized annual regular LIHEAP funds at $5.1 billion per year from FY2005 through FY2007. The federal LIHEAP statute has very broad guidelines, with many decisions regarding the program's operation made by the states. Recipients may be helped with their heating and cooling costs, receive crisis assistance, have weatherizing expenses paid, or receive other aid designed to reduce their home energy needs. The current statutory LIHEAP formula was enacted in 1984 as part of P.L. 98-558, the Human Services Reauthorization Act. The statutory formula replaced a formula from a predecessor program to LIHEAP, the Low Income Energy Assistance Program (LIEAP), which was active for one year (FY1981) prior to enactment of LIHEAP. The LIEAP formula emphasized the heating needs of cold-weather states. When Congress changed the LIHEAP formula in 1984, there were two primary differences from the previous formula: home heating needs were not emphasized to the same degree, and the law provided that HHS use the most recent data available to calculate allotments (the LIEAP formula used static data to distribute funds to the states). The LIHEAP statutory formula provides for three different methods to calculate each state's allotment of regular funds. The calculation method used to determine state allotments depends upon the size of the appropriation in a particular year. If the annual appropriation level is at or below the equivalent of a hypothetical FY1984 appropriation of $1.975 billion, then the \"old\" LIHEAP formula percentages apply. If appropriations exceed a hypothetical FY1984 appropriation of $1.975 billion, then \"new\" formula",

    "crs_R44736": "This distinction between appropriations and general legislation as two separate classes of measures, and their consideration in separate legislative vehicles, is a construct of congressional rules and practices. It has been developed and formalized by the House and Senate pursuant to the constitutional authority for each chamber to \"determine the Rules of its Proceedings.\" This power permits each chamber of Congress to enforce, modify, waive, repeal, or ignore its rules as it sees fit. Because the two chambers exercise this rulemaking authority independently, they have developed differing (albeit generally similar) rules and practices. This report addresses solely developments in the House. According to Hinds' Precedents, the origin of a formal rule mandating the separation of general legislation from appropriations can be traced to 1835, when the House debated the increasing problem of delay in enacting appropriations due to the inclusion of \"debatable matters of another character, new laws which created long debates in both Houses\" and suggested that the Committee on Ways and Means should \"strip the appropriation bills of every thing but were legitimate matters of appropriation.\" In 1876, language was added to House rules that stated: No appropriation shall be reported in such general appropriation bills, or be in order as an amendment thereto, for any expenditure not previously authorized by law. This rule was applied broadly on occasion to exclude legislative provisions authorizing new expenditures as well, such as a case in 1838 when it was used to exclude an amendment that included a provision for refurnishing the White House. Gradually, the rule was construed through a long line of decisions to admit amendments increasing salaries but as excluding amendments providing for decreases. The Holman rule was retained in this form until 1880 (46th Congress), when it was modified to define retrenchments as the reduction of \"the number and salary of officers of the United States, the reduction of compensation of any person paid out of the Treasury of the United States, or the reduction of the amounts of money covered by the bill.\" That form of the rule remained a part of House rules until the 49th Congress eliminated it in 1885. It was reinserted in the rules for the 52nd and 53rd Congresses (1891-1895) but was again dropped for the 54th through 61st Congresses (1895",

According to contemporaneous U.S. documents, Iran wanted to construct 10-20 nuclear power reactors and produce more than 20,000 megawatts of nuclear power by 1994. Iran also began constructing a light-water nuclear power reactor near the city of Bushehr, and it considered obtaining uranium enrichment and reprocessing technology. Iran has begun to operate the Bushehr reactor, and Tehran says it intends to build additional reactors to generate 20,000 megawatts of power within the next 20 years. The 2015 Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) requires Iran to refrain from building heavy-water-moderated reactors for 15 years. Pursuant to the agreement, Iran has pledged to refrain from constructing any such reactors indefinitely. Iranian officials have asserted that the country can rapidly reconstitute its fissile material production capability, although Tehran has adhered to the JCPOA-specified limits. Iran claims that it wants to produce low-enriched uranium (LEU), which can be used in nuclear power reactors, as well as the Tehran Research Reactor (TRR) and other planned future research reactors. The latter reactors will be used to produce isotopes for medical purposes, according to Tehran.

These lands are heavily concentrated in 12 western states (including Alaska), where the federal government owns roughly half of the overall land area. Four federal agencies\u2014the National Park Service (NPS), Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS), and Bureau of Land Management (BLM), all in the Department of the Interior (DOI), and the U.S. Forest Service (FS) in the Department of Agriculture\u2014administer about 95% of those lands. No single law provides authority for these four agencies to acquire and/or dispose of lands. Rather, Congress provided various acquisition and disposal authorities through laws enacted over more than a century. This report describes the primary authorities of the four federal agencies. The extent to which each of the agencies has authority to acquire and dispose of land, and the nature of the authorities, varies considerably. Some of the agencies have relatively broad authority to acquire and/or dispose of land. Most notably, the BLM has relatively broad authority for both acquisitions and disposals. By contrast, the NPS has no general authority to acquire land to create new park units or to dispose of park lands. The extent of the acquisition and disposal authorities for the FS and the FWS are not nearly as broad as the BLM's but not nearly as restrictive as the NPS's. The FS authority to acquire lands is mostly limited to lands within or contiguous to the boundaries of a national forest. The agency has various authorities to dispose of land, but they are relatively constrained and infrequently used. The FWS has various authorities to acquire lands but no general authority to dispose of its lands. The acquisition authorities differ as to the circumstances in which they apply, and the disposal authorities likewise differ as to their purposes. Thus, where a specific acquisition or disposal by an agency is contemplated, the particular authority at issue should be consulted. In general, the acquisition authorities are designed to allow federal agencies to acquire lands that could be viewed as benefitting from federal management. Among other circumstances, acquisition might be authorized to bring inholdings or lands adjacent to federal lands into federal ownership to improve or simplify management of federal lands. Acquisitions also might be authorized to conserve species, protect natural and cultural resources, and increase opportunities for recreation. The",

    "crs_RL31055": "One of the most common methods for redistributing spending priorities in appropriations bills on the House floor is through offset amendments. House offset amendments generally change spending priorities in a pending appropriations measure by increasing spending for certain activities (or creating spending for new activities not previously included in the bill) and offsetting the increase(s) by decreasing or striking funding for other activities in the bill. For example, an amendment increasing funding for one agency funded in the bill by $3 million and decreasing funding for another agency by the same amount in the same bill would be an offset amendment. These amendments may transfer funds between two activities or among several activities. In addition, certain offset amendments may reduce funding with across-the-board spending reductions. Representatives use offset amendments for a variety of reasons, including to (1) ensure that proposals increasing funding for certain activities in any appropriations measure do not violate parliamentary rules enforcing certain spending ceilings; (2) comply with the prohibition against increasing total spending in a general appropriations bill; (3) garner support for efforts to reduce funding for certain activities by transferring those funds to popular programs; and (4) provide a focal point for discussion of a particular issue.

Much existing broadcast regulation was established prior to 1934 by the Federal Radio Commission, and most provisions of the Radio Act of 1927 were subsumed into Title III of the 1934 Act. Title IV\u2014Procedural and administrative provisions, such as hearings, joint boards, judicial review of the FCC's orders, petitions, and inquiries. Title V\u2014Penal provisions and forfeitures, such as violations of rules and regulations. Title VI\u2014Cable communications, such as the use of cable channels and cable ownership restrictions, franchising, and video programming services provided by telephone companies. Title VII\u2014Miscellaneous provisions and powers, such as war powers of the President, closed captioning of public service announcements, and telecommunications development fund. The FCC's budget is derived from regulatory fees collected by the agency rather than through a direct appropriation. The fees, often referred to as \"Section (9) fees,\" are collected from license holders and certain other entities (e.g., cable television systems). The regulatory fees do not apply to governmental entities, amateur radio operator licensees, nonprofit entities, and certain other non-commercial entities. The FCC is authorized to review the regulatory fees each year and adjust them to reflect changes in its appropriation from year to year.

    "crs_RL31980": "Article II, Section 2, of the Constitution provides that the President shall appoint officers of the United States \"by and with the Advice and Consent of the Senate.\" The method by which the Senate provides advice and consent on presidential nominations, referred to broadly as the confirmation process, serves several purposes. First, largely through committee investigations and hearings, the confirmation process allows the Senate to examine the qualifications of nominees and any potential conflicts of interest. Second, Senators can influence policy through the confirmation process, either by rejecting nominees or by extracting promises from nominees before granting consent. Also, the Senate sometimes has delayed the confirmation process in order to increase its influence with the executive branch on unrelated matters. Senate confirmation is required for several categories of government officials. Military appointments and promotions make up the majority of nominations, approximately 65,000 per two-year Congress, and most are confirmed routinely. Each Congress, the Senate also considers approximately 2,000 civilian nominations, and, again, many of them, such as appointments to or promotions in the Foreign Service, are routine. Civilian nominations considered by the Senate also include federal judges and specified officers in executive departments, independent agencies, and regulatory boards and commissions. Many presidential appointees are confirmed routinely by the Senate. With tens of thousands of nominations each Congress, the Senate cannot possibly consider them all in detail. A regularized process facilitates quick action on thousands of government positions. The Senate may approve en bloc hundreds of nominations at a time, especially military appointments and promotions. The process also allows for close scrutiny of candidates when necessary. Each year, a few hundred nominees to high-level positions are regularly subject to Senate investigations and public hearings. Most of these are routinely approved, while a small number of nominations are disputed and receive more attention from the media and Congress. Judicial nominations, particularly Supreme Court appointees, are generally subject to greater scrutiny than nominations to executive posts, partly because judges may serve for life. Among the executive branch positions, nominees for policymaking positions are more likely to be examined closely, and are slightly less likely to be confirmed, than nominees for non-policy positions. There are several reasons that the Senate confirms a high percentage of nominations. Most nominations and promotions are not to policymaking positions and are of less interest to the Senate.

    "crs_R45653": "Congress has a constitutionally based authority to arrest and detain individuals for refusing to comply with congressional demands for information. The information that Congress seeks, whether to inform itself for lawmaking purposes or to conduct oversight, often lies in the executive branch's possession. And while executive branch officials comply with most congressional requests for information, \"experience has taught that mere requests\" can sometimes be \"unavailing,\" and that \"information which is volunteered is not always accurate or complete.\" The Supreme Court has therefore determined that \"some means of compulsion [is] essential\" for Congress \"to obtain what is needed.\" When Congress finds an inquiry blocked by the withholding of information, or where the traditional process of negotiation and accommodation is considered inappropriate or unavailing, a subpoena\u2014either for testimony or documents\u2014may be used to compel compliance with congressional demands. An individual\u2014whether a member of the public or an executive branch official\u2014has a legal obligation to comply with a duly issued and valid congressional subpoena, unless a valid and overriding privilege or other legal justification permits non-compliance. The subpoena, however, is only as effective as the means by which it is potentially enforced. Without a process by which Congress can coerce compliance or deter non-compliance, the subpoena would be reduced to a formalized request rather than a constitutionally based demand for information. Congress currently employs an ad hoc combination of methods to combat non-compliance with subpoenas. The two predominant methods rely on the authority and participation of another branch of government. First, the criminal contempt statute permits a single house of Congress to certify a contempt citation to the executive branch for the criminal prosecution of an individual who has willfully refused to comply with a committee subpoena. Once the contempt citation is received, any later prosecution lies within the control of the executive branch. Second, Congress may try to enforce a subpoena by seeking a civil judgment declaring that the recipient is legally obligated to comply. This process of civil enforcement relies on the help of the courts to enforce congressional demands. Congress has only rarely resorted to either criminal contempt or civil enforcement to combat non-compliance with",
    "crs_98-35": "The Social Security benefit formula is weighted to replace a greater share of career-average earnings for low-paid workers than for high-paid workers. This means that low-paid workers receive relatively high benefits in relation to their payroll tax contributions, although the dollar amount of their benefits is lower than that provided to high-paid workers. The benefit formula, however, cannot distinguish between workers who have low career-average earnings because they worked for many years at low earnings in Social Security-covered employment and workers who appear to have low career-average earnings because they worked for many years in jobs not covered by Social Security. (Those years show up as zeros in their Social Security earnings records, which, when averaged, lower their career earnings from covered work.) Consequently, workers who split their careers between covered and noncovered employment\u2014even highly paid ones\u2014may also receive the advantage of the weighted formula. The windfall elimination provision (WEP) is a modified benefit formula designed to remove the unintended advantage, or \"windfall,\" of the regular benefit formula for certain retired or disabled workers who spent less than full careers in covered employment and who are also entitled to pension benefits based on earnings from jobs not covered by Social Security. The reduction in initial benefits caused by the WEP is designed to place affected workers in approximately the same position they would have been in had all their earnings been covered by Social Security. The impact of the WEP on low-income workers has been the subject of debate. Proponents of the measure say that it is a reasonable means to prevent payment of overgenerous and unintended benefits to certain workers who otherwise would profit from happenstance (i.e., the mechanics of the Social Security benefit formula). Others criticize how the provision works. They say the arbitrary 40% factor in the windfall elimination formula is an imprecise way to determine the actual windfall when applied to individual cases.

Proponents of the measure say that it is a reasonable means to prevent payment of overgenerous and unintended benefits to certain workers who otherwise would profit from happenstance (i.e., the mechanics of the Social Security benefit formula).

    "crs_R45518": "The 2007-2009 financial crisis threatened the total collapse of the financial system and the real economy. Many assert only huge and unprecedented government interventions staved off this collapse. Others argue that government interventions were unnecessary or potentially exacerbated the crisis. In addition, many argue the crisis revealed that the financial system was excessively risky and the regulatory regime governing the financial system had serious weaknesses. Policymakers responded to the perceived weaknesses in the pre-crisis financial regulatory regime by implementing numerous changes to financial regulation, including to bank regulation. Most notably, Congress passed the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Dodd-Frank Act; P.L. 111-203) in 2010 with the intention of strengthening regulation and addressing risks. In addition, U.S. bank regulators have implemented changes under their existing authorities, many of which generally adhere to the Basel III Accords\u2014an international framework for bank regulation agreed to by U.S. and international bank regulators\u2014that called for making certain bank regulations more stringent. In the ensuing years, some observers raised concerns that the potential benefits of those regulatory changes (e.g., better-managed risks, increased consumer protection, greater systemic stability, potentially higher economic growth over the long term) were outweighed by the potential costs (e.g., compliance costs incurred by banks, reduced credit availability for consumers and businesses, potentially slower economic growth). In response to these concerns, Congress passed the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act (EGRRCP Act; P.L. 115-174) in 2010. Among other things, the law modified certain (1) regulations facing small banks; (2) regulations facing banks large enough to be subjected to Dodd-Frank enhanced regulation but still below the size thresholds exceeded by the very largest banks; and (3) mortgage regulations facing lenders including banks. In addition, federal banking regulatory agencies\u2014the Federal Reserve (the Fed), the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC)\u2014have proposed further changes in regulation. Implementing the regulatory changes prescribed in the aftermath of the crisis and made pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Act occurred over the course of years.

    "crs_R44383": "Persistent annual budget deficits and a large and increasing federal debt have generated discussions over the long-term sustainability of current budget projections. Federal budget deficits declined from 9.8% of gross domestic product (GDP) in FY2009 to 3.8% of GDP in FY2018. However, recent estimates forecast that the government will run deficits (i.e., federal expenditures will exceed revenues) in every year through FY2029. Federal debt totaled $21.516 trillion at the end of FY2018, and as a percentage of GDP (106.0%) was at its highest value since FY1947; $15.761 trillion of that debt (or 77.8% of GDP) was held by the public. This report explores distinctions in the concept and composition of deficits and debt and explains how they interact with economic conditions and other aspects of fiscal policy. The federal government incurs a deficit (also known as a net deficit) when its total outgoing payments (outlays) exceed the total money it collects (revenues). If instead federal revenues are greater than outlays, then the federal government generates a surplus. A balanced budget describes the case where federal receipts equal federal expenditures. The size of a deficit or surplus is equal to the difference between the levels of spending and receipts. Deficits are measured over the course of a defined period of time\u2014in the case of the federal government, a fiscal year. Federal budget outcomes incorporate both \"on-budget\" activities, which represent the majority of federal taxes and spending, and \"off-budget\" government activities, which include revenues and outlays from Social Security trust funds and the Postal Service. For federal credit programs, the subsidy cost of government activities is included in deficit and surplus calculations. The federal budget is constructed in a manner that provides for lower net deficits in more robust economic conditions, attributable to higher revenues (from taxes on increased output) and, to a smaller degree, lower spending levels (from reduced demand for programs like unemployment insurance). The federal government incurred a deficit of $779 billion in FY2018, equivalent to 3.8% of GDP. From FY1969 to FY2018, the average net deficit equaled 2.9% of annual GDP ($587 billion in 2018 dollars). Over the FY1969-FY2018 period, the government generated a surplus on five occasions: in FY1969 and in each",

    "crs_R43661": "The Community Reinvestment Act of 1977 (CRA; P.L. 95-128) was enacted in response to concerns that federally insured banking institutions were not making sufficient credit available in the local areas in which they were chartered and acquiring deposits. The CRA requires federal banking regulators to conduct examinations to assess whether a bank is meeting local credit needs. The regulators issue CRA credits, or points, where banks engage in qualifying activities\u2014such as mortgage, consumer, and business lending; community investments; and low-cost services that would benefit low- and moderate-income (LMI) areas and entities\u2014that occur within assessment areas (where institutions have local deposit-taking operations). These credits are then used to issue each bank a performance rating from a four-tiered system of descriptive performance levels (Outstanding, Satisfactory, Needs to Improve, or Substantial Noncompliance). The CRA's impact on lending activity has been publicly debated. Some observers are concerned that the CRA may induce banks to forgo more profitable lending opportunities in nontargeted neighborhoods by encouraging a disproportionate amount of lending in LMI communities. Furthermore, some argue that the CRA compels banks to make loans to higher-risk borrowers that are more likely to have repayment problems, which may subsequently compromise the financial stability of the banking system. For example, some researchers have attributed the increase in risky lending prior to the 2007-2009 recession to banks attempting to comply with CRA objectives. Others are concerned that enforcement of CRA objectives has not been stringent enough to compel banks to increase financial services in LMI areas. Almost all banks receive Satisfactory or better performance ratings on their CRA examinations, which some may consider indicative of weak enforcement. This report informs the congressional debate concerning the CRA's effectiveness in incentivizing bank lending and investment activity to LMI customers. It begins with a description of bank CRA examinations, including how a bank delineates its assessment area; the activities that may qualify for points under the three tests (i.e., lending, investment, and service) that collectively make up the CRA examination; and how the composite CRA rating is calculated. Next, the report analyzes the difficulty in attributing bank lending decisions to CRA incentives. For example, the CRA does not specify the quality and quantity",
    "crs_R45665": "Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, as amended, outlaws racial discrimination in all federally funded programs, activities, and institutions. It does not define, however, the sorts of practices Title VI thereby excludes. And with the legislative history on this point inconclusive at best, the task of providing a workable definition has been left to the agencies charged with enforcing Title VI and, ultimately, to the courts. The Supreme Court appears to have definitively resolved the first of those ambiguities: because Title VI simply \"enacts constitutional principles,\" as currently written, it prohibits only intentional discrimination. And on that basis the Court has suggested, but not definitively ruled on, how it might resolve the second ambiguity as well: to effectuate Title VI's purpose, an agency may outlaw only policies resulting from a provable discriminatory intent, not simply having a racially discriminatory effect. Whether the Court will turn that suggestion into a holding remains to be seen. Until then, however, federal agencies like the Office for Civil Rights (OCR) in the U.S. Department of Education (ED) will likely continue to enforce Title VI consistent with constitutional standards that the Court has since read into the statute. In OCR's case that enforcement work is already considerable, involving thousands of complaints every year culminating in significant resolutions across a wide range of schools and institutions of higher education.

    "crs_R45693": "The federal government subsidizes a wide range of activities through the tax code. The majority of available tax incentives are claimed directly by the party engaged in the activity targeted by the subsidy. There are several tax credits, however, that often require or encourage the intended beneficiary of the subsidy to partner with a third party to use the tax incentive. This may happen because the tax credits are nonrefundable and the intended beneficiary of the tax credit has little or no tax liability (e.g., a nonprofit), or because the credits are delivered over multiple years whereas upfront funding is needed to break g round. This situation often results in a tax equity transaction\u2014the intended beneficiary of the tax credit agrees to transfer the rights to claim the credits to a third party in exchange for an equity financing contribution. One estimate placed the size of the tax equity market in 2017 at $20 billion. This report provides an introduction to the general tax equity financing mechanism. To facilitate the presentation of the tax equity approach to subsidization, three categories of tax credits that either currently use or have recently used this mechanism are examined: the low-income housing tax credit (LIHTC); the new markets tax credit (NMTC); and two energy-related tax credits\u2014the renewable electricity production tax credit (PTC) and energy investment tax credit (ITC). This report does not evaluate the economic rationale for subsidizing the activities targeted by these tax credits, and does not analyze whether these subsidies increase net investment in these activities.

    "crs_R45100": "Antipoverty interventions that provide resources to local communities, based on the characteristics of those communities, have been of interest to Congress. One such policy, dubbed the \"10-20-30 provision,\" was implemented in the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (ARRA, P.L. 111-5). Title I, Section 105 of ARRA required the Secretary of Agriculture to allocate at least 10% of funds provided in that act from three rural development program accounts to persistent poverty counties; that is, to counties that have had poverty rates of 20% or more for the past 30 years, as measured by the 1980, 1990, and 2000 decennial censuses. One notable characteristic of this provision is that it did not increase spending for the rural development programs addressed in ARRA, but rather targeted existing funds differently. Given Congress's interest both in addressing poverty and being mindful about levels of federal spending, the past four Congresses included 10-20-30 language in multiple appropriations bills, some of which were enacted into law. However, the original language used in ARRA could not be used verbatim, because the data source used by ARRA to define persistent poverty\u2014the decennial census\u2014tops collecting income information. As a consequence, the appropriations bills varied slightly in their definitions of \"persistent poverty\" as it was applied to various programs and departments, sometimes even within different sections of the same bill, if the bill included language on different programs. In turn, because the definitions of \"persistent poverty\" differed, so did the lists of counties identified as persistently poor and subject to the 10-20-30 provision. The bills included legislation for rural development, public works and economic development, technological innovation, and brownfields site assessment and remediation. Most recently, in the 116th Congress, much of the language used in these previous bills was included in P.L. 116-6 (Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2019). This report discusses how data source selection, and the rounding of poverty estimates, can affect the list of counties identified as persistently poor. After briefly explaining why targeting funds to persistent poverty counties might be of interest, this report explores how \"persistent poverty\" is defined and measured, and how different interpretations of the definition and different data source selections could yield different lists of counties identified as persistently poor.

Among other requirements, the act prohibits the unauthorized discharge of pollutants into \"navigable waters,\" and requires persons wishing to discharge dredged or fill material into \"navigable waters\" to obtain a permit from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (Corps). In its definition section, the act defines the term \"navigable waters\" to mean \"waters of the United States, including its territorial seas.\" This single, jurisdiction-defining phrase applies to the entire law, including the national pollutant discharge elimination system (NPDES) permit program; permit requirements for disposal of dredged or fill material, known as the Section 404 program; water quality standards and measures to attain them; oil spill liability and prevention; and enforcement. The Clean Water Act itself does not expand further on the meaning of \"waters of the United States.\" Instead, the Corps and EPA have expounded on this phrase through agency guidance and regulations, which federal courts have struck down on various occasions as failing to satisfy statutory or constitutional requirements. Federal authority to regulate waters within the United States primarily derives from the Commerce Clause, which gives Congress the power to \"regulate commerce with foreign nations, and among the several states.\" Accordingly, federal laws and regulations regulating waters of the United States cannot cover matters that exceed that constitutional source of authority.

Many Congolese reacted positively to the results. Whether the election was \"democratic\" is debatable, however, as is the degree to which Tshisekedi's presidency represents a \"transfer of power.\" Former President Kabila\u2014whose decision to cling to power past the end of his two constitutionally permitted terms in 2016 sparked a national political crisis and widespread protests\u2014appears poised to retain significant political influence. Kabila, who first assumed the presidency in 2000, now holds the title of \"Senator-for-Life,\" while his Common Front for Congo (FCC) coalition won sweeping majorities in parliament and provincial assemblies, and in subsequent indirect elections for the Senate and provincial governors. Tshisekedi's Union for Democracy and Social Progress (UDPS) won very few sub-national contests, and it has agreed to form a coalition government with the FCC. These factors, along with evidence that a more hardline opposition figure won more votes than Tshisekedi, have led many observers to speculate that the official election results reflected a power-sharing deal between Tshisekedi and Kabila (see \"Policys\").

Localities are primarily responsible for providing wastewater and drinking water infrastructure services. According to the most recent estimates by states and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), expected capital costs for such facilities total $744 billion over a 20-year period. While some analysts and stakeholders debate whether these estimates understate or overstate capital needs, most agree that the affected communities face formidable challenges in providing adequate and reliable water infrastructure services. Capital investments in water infrastructure are necessary to maintain high quality service that protects public health and the environment, and capital facilities are a major investment for local governments. The vast majority of public capital projects are debt-financed (i.e., they are not financed on a pay-as-you-go basis from ongoing revenues to the water utility). The principal financing tool that local governments use is the issuance of tax-exempt municipal bonds. At least 70% of U.S. water utilities rely on municipal bonds and other debt to some degree to finance capital investments. Beyond municipal bonds, federal assistance through grants and loans is available for some projects but is insufficient to meet all needs. Finally, public-private partnerships (P3s), which are long-term contractual arrangements between a public utility and a private company, currently provide only limited capital financing in the water sector. Although they are increasingly used in transportation and some other infrastructure sectors, especially P3s that involve private sector debt or equity investment in a project, most P3s for water infrastructure involve contract operations for operation and maintenance. Numerous drinking water utilities are privately owned and make significant private capital investments in water infrastructure, unlike the wastewater sector, in which facilities are generally owned by municipalities. In recent years, Congress has considered several legislative options to help finance water infrastructure projects, including projects to build and upgrade wastewater and drinking water treatment facilities. Some Members have offered proposals that would amend, supplement, and/or complement the existing clean water and drinking water State Revolving Fund (SRF) programs. Other proposals would address water infrastructure issues outside the framework of the SRF programs. In 2014, Congress established the Water Infrastructure Finance and Innovation Act (WIFIA) program, which creates a new mechanism of providing financial assistance for water infrastructure projects. The act authorized appropriations of $175 million over five years to both EPA and the Army Corps of",

Because the condition and performance of freight infrastructure play a considerable role in the efficiency of the freight system, federal support of freight infrastructure investment is likely to be of significant congressional concern in the reauthorization of the surface transportation program. The program is currently authorized by the Fixing America's Surface Transportation Act (FAST Act; P.L. 114-94), which is scheduled to expire on September 30, 2020. Congress has begun to place greater emphasis on freight over the course of recent reauthorizations, but national policy is still vague or silent on a number of issues. There are ongoing disagreements about the best way to accomplish improvements in freight system infrastructure\u2014notably, how to raise new funds for investment, the magnitude of the amounts required, which projects to prioritize, and the role of the federal government in the planning process. Meanwhile, technological advances in mobility have prompted new questions about how best to accomplish the efficient movement of people and goods in a multimodal transportation system. Autonomous vehicle technology could have potential applications in the trucking industry, as could greater deployment of automation in the rail and port industries. While the FAST Act concerns many aspects of surface transportation funding and safety policy, the focus of this report is on truck freight and that portion of the rail and port industries that transports truck trailers and containers (intermodal freight). This report does not address operational issues that also may be of interest during reauthorization, such as hours of service and hazardous material transport safety. Moreover, this report does not contain in-depth discussion of environmental issues associated with freight movements, such as carbon emissions and climate change, or air and noise pollution, though these issues may be germane to the topics of funding and project selection.",
    "crs_R44795": "The federal government is vested with the exclusive power to create rules governing alien entry and removal. However, the impact of alien migration\u2014whether lawful or unlawful\u2014is arguably felt most directly in the communities where aliens reside. State and local responses to unlawfully present aliens within their jurisdictions have varied considerably, particularly in determining the role th at state or local police should play in enforcing federal immigration law. At one end of the spectrum, some states and localities actively assist federal immigration authorities in identifying and apprehending aliens for removal. For example, jurisdictions sometimes enter into \"287(g) Agreements\" with the federal government, in which state or local law enforcement are deputized to perform certain immigration enforcement activities. Some states and localities have attempted to play an even greater role in immigration enforcement, in many cases because of perceptions that federal efforts have been inadequate. In the past, some have adopted measures that criminally sanction conduct believed to facilitate the presence of unlawfully present aliens and have also instructed police to actively work to detect such aliens as part of their regular duties. The adoption of these kinds of measures has waned considerably, though, after the Supreme Court's 2012 ruling in Arizona v. United States held that several provisions of one such enactment, Arizona's S.B. 1070, were preempted by federal immigration law. Subsequent lower court decisions struck down many other state and local measures that imposed criminal or civil sanctions on immigration-related activity. At the other end of the spectrum, some states and localities have been less willing to assist the federal government with its immigration enforcement responsibilities. Often dubbed \"sanctuary jurisdictions,\" some states and localities have adopted measures that limit their participation in enforcing federal immigration laws, including, for example, prohibiting police officers from assisting with federal efforts to identify and apprehend unlawfully present aliens within the state or locality's jurisdiction. That said, there is debate over both the meaning and application of the term \"sanctuary jurisdiction.\" Additionally, state and local jurisdictions have varied reasons for choosing not to cooperate with federal immigration enforcement efforts, including reasons not necessarily motivated by disagreement with federal immigration enforcement policies, such as concern about potential civil liability or the availability of state or local resources to assist federal immigration enforcement efforts.

Historically, the federal crop insurance program has covered primarily traditional field crops such as wheat, corn, and soybeans. In contrast, specialty crops\u2014covering fruits, vegetables, tree nuts, and nursery crops\u2014have not been a major part of the federal crop insurance program. However, legislative changes, coupled with ongoing administrative efforts by the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), have expanded federal crop insurance coverage for specialty crops, and they now account for a small but growing number of federal crop insurance policies bought by farmers. Over the past few decades, total specialty crop insured liabilities rose from nearly $1 billion in 1989 to nearly $18.5 billion in 2017. Federal crop insurance policies currently cover around 38 specialty crop categories, which include roughly 80 types of fruits, vegetables, tree nuts, and nursery crops. Many specialty crops, however, do not have crop-specific insurance policies. Currently, about one-half of all U.S. specialty crop acres are covered by federal crop insurance policies. Some specialty crops may be covered under a Whole Farm Revenue Protection (WFRP) insurance policy, intended to fill in coverage gaps for producers of uninsured crops that lack individual policy coverage and for producers marketing to local, farm-identity preserved, or direct markets. Despite this expansion, coverage for specialty crops remains below that for traditional crops. Combined, federal crop insurance for specialty crops and WFRP together accounted for about 17% of the entire federal crop insurance portfolio by liability during crop year 2017. This report focuses on how specialty crops are covered under the federal crop insurance program.

The move to place restrictions on the owners of the networks that compose and provide access to the internet, to ensure equal access and nondiscriminatory treatment, is referred to as \"net neutrality.\" There is no single accepted definition of \"net neutrality.\" However, most agree that any such definition should include the general principles that owners of the networks that compose and provide access to the internet should not control how consumers lawfully use that network, and they should not be able to discriminate against content provider access to that network. A major focus in the debate is concern over whether the regulatory framework as delineated in the Federal Communications Commission's (FCC's) 2015 Open Internet Order is the appropriate approach to ensure access to the internet for content, services, and applications providers, as well as consumers, or whether a less regulatory approach contained in the 2017 Order is more suitable. The issue of regulation of and access to broadband networks is currently being addressed in three venues at the FCC, where the commissioners on December 14, 2017, adopted (3-2) an Order that went into effect on June 11, 2018, that revokes the 2015 regulatory framework in favor of one that reverses the 2015 classification of broadband internet access services as a telecommunications service under Title II of the Communications Act, provides for a less regulatory approach, and shifts much of the oversight from the FCC to the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) and the Department of Justice (DOJ); in the courts, where consolidated petitions for review of the 2017 Order are under consideration in the U.S. Court of Appeals, D.C.

Nigeria has overtaken South Africa as Africa's largest economy, and it is one of the world's major sources of high-quality crude oil. The country's commercial center, Lagos, is among the world's largest cities. Nigeria has the fastest-growing population globally, which is forecast to reach 410 million by 2050 and overtake the United States to become the world's third-most populous country. It also has one of Africa's largest militaries, and has played an important role in peace and stability operations on the continent. Few states in Africa have the capacity to make a more decisive impact on the region. Despite its oil wealth, Nigeria remains highly underdeveloped. Poor governance and corruption have limited infrastructure development and social service delivery, slowing economic growth and keeping much of the country mired in poverty. Nigeria has the world's second-largest HIV/AIDS-infected population and Africa's highest tuberculosis burden. The country is home to more than 250 ethnic groups, but the northern Hausa and Fulani, the southwestern Yoruba, and the southeastern Igbo have traditionally been the most politically active and dominant. Roughly half the population, primarily residing in the north, is Muslim. Southern Nigeria is predominantly Christian, and Nigeria's Middle Belt (which spans the country's central zone) is a diverse mix. Ethnic and religious strife have been common in Nigeria. Tens of thousands of Nigerians have been killed in sectarian and intercommunal clashes in the past two decades. Ethnic, regional, and sectarian divisions often stem from issues related to access to land, jobs, and socioeconomic development, and are sometimes fueled by politicians.

During the past two decades, Congress has established or renewed the existence of hundreds of statutory entities to study, advise on, coordinate, or monitor matters of particular interest to Congress. These entities vary in several dimensions, including their official designation, purpose, lifespan, membership, and mechanism by which members are appointed. Many of these bodies are expressly identified as commissions, but others are designated as boards, advisory committees, or other terms. In this report, they are referred to generically as \"congressional advisory bodies.\" These groups are sometimes created to address a single purpose\u2014to study a discrete policy issue or to attend to one-time or recurring administrative functions. Often, they have a well-defined mandate, which typically includes the submission of a final report to Congress with detailed findings and recommendations. Although some have a specific lifespan, others have been created to provide ongoing support and advice (e.g., the boards of visitors for the U.S. military service academies, or the Commission to Recommend Individuals to the President for Appointment to the Office of Architect of the Capitol).

Congressional interest in these programs has increased in recent years, primarily because assisting small business is viewed as a means to enhance economic growth. The SBA's Surety Bond Guarantee Program has been operational since April 1971. It is designed to increase small business' access to federal, state, and local government contracting, as well as private-sector contracting, by guaranteeing bid, performance, payment, and specified ancillary bonds \"on contracts... for small and emerging contractors who cannot obtain bonding through regular commercial channels.\" The program guarantees individual contracts of up to $6.5 million, and up to $10 million if a federal contracting officer certifies that such a guarantee is necessary. The $6.5 million limit is periodically adjusted for inflation. The SBA's guarantee currently ranges from 80% to 90% of the surety's loss if a default occurs. In FY2018, the SBA guaranteed 10,800 bid and final surety bonds (a payment bond, performance bond, or both a payment and performance bond) with a total contract value of nearly $6.5 billion. Although the surety industry does not report the total value of the bonds it issues each year, estimates based on the total amount of premiums collected by the private sector in recent years suggest that the SBA's Surety Bond Guarantee Program represents, by design, a relatively small percentage of the market for surety bonds (from about 1.1% to 6.7% of the value of surety bonds issued by the private sector). The SBA's Surety Bond Guarantee Program is authorized to guarantee surety bonds issued to contractors or subcontractors when the business, together with its affiliates, meets the SBA's size standard for the primary industry in which it is engaged; the bond is required; the applicant is not able to obtain such bond on reasonable terms and conditions without a guarantee; and there is a reasonable expectation that the applicant will perform the covenants and conditions of the contract",

The emerging 5G technologies are expected to improve networks, meet the growing demand for data from consumers, support new services, and enable a seamless connected society. The United States is leading 5G deployment by identifying and allocating spectrum for 5G use and easing regulations related to the placement of 5G equipment. However, there are factors that may hinder 5G deployment in the United States, including the complex spectrum allocation process, local resistance to 5G cell siting regulations, and limitations on trade that may affect the availability of 5G equipment and devices.

    "crs_R45664": "Over the past decade, money launderers have turned to a new technology to conceal the origins of illegally obtained proceeds: virtual currency. Virtual currencies like Bitcoin, Ether, and Ripple are digital representations of value that, like ordinary currency, function as media of exchange, units of account, and stores of value. However, unlike ordinary currency, virtual currencies are not legal tender, meaning they cannot be used to pay taxes and creditors need not accept them as payments for debt. According to their proponents, virtual currencies (1) have the potential to offer cheaper and faster transactions than traditional bank-centric payment networks, (2) provide inflation-resistant alternatives to traditional fiat currencies, and (3) often involve promising new technologies (such as blockchain technology) that will spur innovation across a variety of fields. However, other commentators have argued that the anonymity offered by certain decentralized virtual currencies\u2014that is, virtual currencies that are not issued or maintained by a central organization\u2014makes them an attractive vehicle for money laundering. These observers have contended that criminals often use such virtual currencies not only to buy and sell illicit goods and services, but also to launder illegally obtained fiat currencies. While it is difficult to definitively assess the volume of money laundered through virtual currencies, the virtual currency security firm CipherTrace has estimated that criminals laundered roughly $2.5 billion of Bitcoin on major exchanges between January 9, 2009, and September 20, 2018.

    "crs_R45488": "The combination of growing supplies of liquefied natural gas (LNG) and new requirements for less polluting fuels in the international maritime shipping industry has heightened interest in LNG as a maritime fuel. For decades, LNG tanker ships have been capable of burning boil-off gas from their LNG cargoes as a secondary fuel. However, using LNG as a primary fuel is a relatively new endeavor; the first LNG-powered vessel\u2014a Norwegian ferry\u2014began service in 2000. Several aspects of LNG use in shipping may be of congressional interest. LNG as an engine, or \"bunker,\" fuel potentially could help the United States reduce harmful air emissions, it could create a new market for domestic natural gas, and it could create economic opportunities in domestic shipbuilding. However, U.S. ports would need specialized vessels and land-based infrastructure for LNG \"bunkering\" (vessel refueling) as well as appropriate regulatory oversight of the associated shipping and fueling operations. The storage, delivery, and use of LNG in shipping also has safety implications. These and other aspects of LNG bunkering may become legislative or oversight issues for Congress. One bill in the 115th Congress, the Waterway LNG Parity Act of 2017 (S. 505), would have imposed excise taxes on LNG used by marine vessels on inland waterways. This report discusses impending International Maritime Organization (IMO) standards limiting the maximum sulfur content in shipping fuels, the market conditions in which LNG may compete to become a common bunker fuel for vessel operators, and the current status of LNG bunkering globally and in the United States. A broader discussion of oil market implications is outside the scope of this report. The IMO is the United Nations organization that negotiates standards for international shipping. Its standards limiting sulfur emissions from ships, adopted in 2008, have led vessel operators to consider alternatives to petroleum-based fuels to power their ships. In 1973, the IMO adopted the International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships (MARPOL). Annex VI of the convention, which came into force in 2005, deals with air pollution from ships. The annex established limits on nitrogen oxide (NOx) emissions and set a 4.5% limit on the allowable sulfur content in vessel fuels. In 2008, the IMO announced a timeline to reduce the maximum sulfur content in vessel fuels",

The events of September 11, 2001, changed this as insurers realized the extent of possible terrorism losses. Estimates of insured losses from the 9/11 attacks are more than $45 billion in current dollars, the largest insured losses from a nonnatural disaster on record. These losses were concentrated in business interruption insurance (34% of the losses), property insurance (30%), and liability insurance (23%). Although primary insurance companies\u2014those that actually sell and service the insurance policies bought by consumers\u2014suffered losses from the terrorist attacks, the heaviest insured losses were absorbed by foreign and domestic reinsurers, the insurers of insurance companies. Because of the lack of public data on, or modeling of, the scope and nature of the terrorism risk, reinsurers felt unable to accurately price for such risks and largely withdrew from the market for terrorism risk insurance in the months following September 11, 2001. Once reinsurers stopped offering coverage for terrorism risk, primary insurers, suffering equally from a lack of public data and models, also withdrew, or tried to withdraw, from the market. In most states, state regulators must approve policy form changes. Most state regulators agreed to insurer requests to exclude terrorism risks from commercial policies, just as these policies had long excluded war risks. Terrorism risk insurance was soon unavailable or extremely expensive, and many businesses were no longer able to purchase insurance that would protect them in future terrorist attacks. In some cases, such insurance is required to consummate various transactions, particularly in the real estate, transportation, construction, energy, and utility sectors. Although the evidence is largely anecdotal, some were concerned that the lack of coverage posed a threat of serious harm\u2014such as job loss\u2014to these industries, in turn threatening the broader economy. In November 2002, Congress responded to the fears of economic damage due to the absence of commercially available coverage for terrorism with passage of the Terrorism Risk Insurance Act (TRIA). TRIA created a three-year Terrorism Insurance Program to provide a government reinsurance backstop in the case of terrorist attacks. The TRIA program was amended and extended in 2005, 2007, and 2015.

    "crs_R45666": "The prices paid by consumers for prescription drugs have been a recent area of significant congressional interest. Several committees in the House and Senate have held hearings this year on drug pricing issues, and a number of bills have been introduced in the 116th Congress that seek to address the perceived high costs of prescription drugs and other pharmaceutical products. Because intellectual property (IP) rights, including patent rights and regulatory exclusivities, play an important role in the development and pricing of pharmaceutical products, a key focus of this debate is whether existing IP law promptly balances the need for innovation with the costs that IP may impose on the public. Understanding the interplay between several complex legal regimes is necessary in order to fully make sense of this debate. IP law comprises a set of exclusive rights that prevent others from making, copying, or using certain intangible creations of the human mind. Federal law contains several different varieties of IP, depending on the type of intellectual creation at issue. For example, copyright law generally grants authors of original creative works (such as literary works or musical compositions) the exclusive right to reproduce their work, publicly perform and display it, distribute it, and adapt it, for a specified term of years. Other species of federal IP include patent law, which protects novel inventions, and trademark law, which protects symbols used to identify goods and services. Each form of IP covers a different type of creation, has a different procedure for obtaining rights, and grants the IP owner legal rights that vary in scope and duration. Although each of these forms of IP is legally distinct, they broadly share a common motivation: providing incentives to create. Patents and copyrights are typically justified by a utilitarian rationale that exclusive rights are necessary to provide incentives to produce new creative works and technological inventions. This rationale maintains that absent legal protections, competitors could freely copy such creations, denying the original creators the ability to recoup their investments in time and effort, and thereby reduce the incentive to create in the first place. IP incentives are said to be particularly necessary for products, such as pharmaceuticals, that are costly to develop but easily copied once marketed. In the words of the Supreme Court, IP rights are premised on an \"economic philosophy\" that the \"encouragement of individual effort by personal gain is the best way to advance public welfare through the talents of authors and inventors.\" From this",

Eligibility requirements and payment limits are central to how various U.S. farm programs operate. These requirements fundamentally address various equity concerns and reflect the goals of government intervention in agriculture. They determine who receives federal farm program payments and how much they receive. Eligibility requirements and payment limits are controversial because they influence what size farms are supported. Policymakers have debated what limit is optimal for annual payments, whether payments should be proportional to production or limited per individual or per farm operation, and whether the limit should be specific to each program or cumulative across all programs. Furthermore, program eligibility requirements and payment limits generate considerable congressional interest because their effects differ across regions and by type of commodities produced and because a substantial amount of annual U.S. farm program payments are at stake: Direct federal outlays have averaged $13.7 billion per year from 1996 through 2017. When federal crop insurance premium subsidies are included, annual farm payments have averaged $18.5 billion over the same period.

It describes current restrictions that limit or preclude payments to farmers based on a number of factors as well as areas where few, if any, restrictions limit farmers' access to such benefits or to the amount of benefits. This report begins by discussing farm program eligibility, including the primary types of legal entities participating in farm programs. Other limiting requirements are discussed, such as participant identification, citizenship, the current interpretation of what constitutes \"actively engaged in farming\" (AEF), adjusted gross income (AGI) limits, and conservation compliance. This is followed by a discussion of the direct attribution of payments to individual recipients for assessing whether a person's payment limit has been exceeded. Next, annual payment limits for the major categories of farm programs are examined. Much of this information is summarized in Table 1. This report also discusses several issues related to farm program payment limits, including policy design issues, that may be of interest to Congress.

At the beginning of the 116th Congress, the House adopted a standing rule that would provide for legislation suspending the statutory debt limit to be considered as passed by the House, without a separate vote, when the House adopts the budget resolution for a fiscal year. This House rule is similar to a previous one related to the debt limit (commonly referred to as the \"Gephardt rule,\" named after its original sponsor, former Representative Richard Gephardt), which was first adopted in 1979 but was repealed at the beginning of the 112th Congress in 2011. The House may also consider debt limit legislation without resorting to the new debt limit rule (and also did so under the former Gephardt rule) either as freestanding legislation, as part of another measure, or as part of a budget reconciliation bill. The Senate does not have (and has never had) a comparable procedure. If it chooses under the new rule to consider such debt limit legislation, it would do so under its regular legislative process. This report first explains the current House debt limit rule, particularly in relation to the former Gephardt rule. Then, it describes the legislative history of the former rule and reviews how the former rule operated before it was repealed at the beginning of the 112th Congress.",
    "crs_R45456": "The Fifth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution provides that \"[n]o person shall be held to answer for a capital, or otherwise infamous crime, unless on a presentment or indictment of a Grand Jury.\" This provision requires that a federal prosecutor, in order to charge a suspect with a serious federal crime, secure the assent of an independent investigative and deliberative body comprising citizens drawn from the jurisdiction in which the crime would be tried. Federal grand juries serve two primary functions: (1) they aid federal prosecutors in investigating possible crimes by issuing subpoenas for documents, physical evidence, and witness testimony; and (2) they determine whether there is sufficient evidence to charge a criminal suspect with the crime or crimes under investigation. Traditionally, the grand jury has done its work in secret. Secrecy prevents those under scrutiny from fleeing or importuning the grand jurors, encourages full disclosure by witnesses, and protects the innocent from unwarranted prosecution, among other things. The long-established rule of grand jury secrecy is enshrined in Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 6(e), which provides that government attorneys and the jurors themselves, among others, \"must not disclose a matter occurring before the grand jury.\" Accordingly, as a general matter, persons and entities external to the grand jury process are precluded from obtaining transcripts of grand jury testimony or other documents or information that would reveal \"what took place\" in the proceedings, even if the grand jury has concluded its work and even if the information is sought pursuant to otherwise-valid legal processes. At times, the rule of grand jury secrecy has come into tension with Congress's power of inquiry when an arm of the legislative branch has sought protected materials pursuant to its oversight function. For example, some courts have determined that the information barrier established in Rule 6(e) extends to congressional inquiries, noting that the Rule \"contains no reservations in favor of.. congressional access to grand jury materials\" that would otherwise remain secret. Nevertheless, the rule of grand jury secrecy is subject to a number of exceptions, both codified and judicially crafted, that permit grand jury information to be disclosed in certain circumstances (usually only with prior judicial authorization).

    "crs_R41479": "Social Security provides dependent benefits and survivors benefits, sometimes collectively referred to as auxiliary benefits, to the spouses, former spouses, widow(er)s, children, and parents of retired, disabled, or deceased workers. Auxiliary benefits are based on the work record of the household's primary earner. Social Security spousal benefits (i.e., benefits for a wife or husband of the primary earner) are payable to the spouse or divorced spouse of a retired or disabled worker. Social Security survivors benefits are payable to the survivors of a deceased worker as a widow(er), as a child, as a mother or father of the deceased worker's child(ren), or as a dependent parent of the deceased worker. Although Social Security is often viewed as a program that primarily provides benefits to retired or disabled workers, 33% of new benefit awards in 2017 were made to the dependents and survivors of retired, disabled, and deceased workers. Spousal and survivors benefits play an important role in ensuring women's retirement security. In December 2017, about 25.4 million elderly (aged 65 and older) women received Social Security benefits, including 13.3 million women who received only retired-worker benefits, 2.1 million women who were entitled solely as the spouse of a retired worker, 3.2 million women who were entitled solely as the survivor of a deceased worker, and 6.7 million women who were dually entitled to a retired-worker benefit and a spousal or survivor benefit. In 2017, Social Security provided 50% or more of family income for more than 53% of elderly women in beneficiary families and 90% or more of family income for about 28% of elderly women in beneficiary families. Women continue to be vulnerable to poverty in old age for several reasons. These reasons can generally be split into demographic reasons and economic reasons. In addition, the design of auxiliary benefits can lead to equity concerns. With respect to demographic and economic reasons that lead to adequacy concerns, women on average live longer than men, and thus more women are likely to be widowed than are men.

    "crs_R44125": "The consumer data industry collects and subsequently provides information to firms about behavior when consumers conduct various financial transactions. Firms use this data to determine whether consumers have engaged a behavior that could be costly or beneficial to the firms. For example, lenders rely upon credit reports and scoring systems to determine the likelihood that prospective borrowers will repay their loans. The data may also be used to predict consumer behaviors that would financially benefit firms. Although the general public is likely to be more familiar with the use of credit reporting and scoring to qualify for mortgage and other consumer loans, the scope of consumer data use is much broader. Indepository institutions (i.e., banks and credit unions) rely on consumer data service providers to determine whether to make checking accounts or loans available to individuals. Insurance companies use consumer data to determine what insurance products to make available and to set policy premiums. Merchants rely on the consumer data industry to determine whether to approve payment by check or electronic payment card. Employers may use consumer data information to screen prospective employees to determine, for example, the likelihood of fraudulent behavior. In short, numerous firms rely upon consumer data to identify and evaluate the risks associated with entering into financial relationships or transactions with consumers. Greater reliance by firms on consumer data significantly affects consumer access to financial products or opportunities. For example, negative or derogatory information, such as multiple overdrafts, involuntary account closures, loan defaults, and fraud incidents, may influence a lender to deny a consumer access to credit. Further, such information may stay on a consumer's reports for several years. The inclusion of negative information may be particularly limiting to consumers under circumstances in which such information is inaccurate or needs to be updated to reflect more current and possibly more favorable financial situations. Furthermore, consumers may find the process of making corrections to consumer data reports to be time-consuming, complex, and perhaps ineffective. The exclusion of more favorable information, such as the timely repayment of noncredit obligations, from standard credit reporting or scoring models may also limit credit access. This report first provides background information on the consumer data industry and various specialty areas. The report examines one prominent specialty area\u2014consumer scoring\u2014and describes various factors used to calculate credit scores. Next, the report provides a general description of the current regulatory framework of the consumer data industry.

Congress deliberated and passed the act at a time when concern about environmental degradation spurred passage of many of the nation's environmental statutes. CZMA sets up a national framework for states and territories to consider and manage coastal resources. If a state or territory chooses to develop a coastal management program and the program is approved, the state or territory (1) becomes eligible for several federal grants and (2) can perform reviews of federal agency actions in coastal areas (known as federal consistency determination reviews). Since 1972, many of the trends that called congressional attention to coastal management have continued. Over a third of the U.S. population lived in shoreline counties in 2010, with more expected by 2020 as people continue to migrate to coastal areas to take advantage of economic opportunities, retire, and pursue recreational interests. Coastal areas are also home to economic sectors such as fishing, transportation, defense, offshore energy, and tourism and to natural resources such as estuaries, beach systems, and wetlands. The shoreline likely will continue to be affected by pressures to develop and preserve areas, large-scale events (e.g., hurricanes and tsunamis), and long-term changes (e.g., relative sea level, changes in rainfall, wetland loss, and increased temperatures). In addition to responding to these pressures, Congress may continue to consider whether CZMA is being effectively implemented and whether changes should be made to CZMA grant programs. This report provides a review of CZMA with a specific focus on the National Coastal Zone Management Program (NCZMP). The report discusses how and why states and territories may choose to participate in the national program (namely to access federal grant programs and undertake federal consistency determination reviews) and recent issues for Congress.

    "crs_R45545": "The House of Representatives has standing rules that govern how bills and resolutions are to be taken up and considered on the floor. However, to expedite legislation receiving floor action, the House may temporarily set aside these rules for measures that are not otherwise privileged for consideration. This can be done by agreeing to a special order of business resolution (special rule) or by adopting a motion to suspend the rules and pass the underlying measure. In general, special rules enable the consideration of complex or contentious legislation, such as major appropriations or reauthorizations, while the suspension of the rules procedure is usually applied to broadly supported legislation that can be approved without floor amendments or extensive debate in the chamber. Most bills and resolutions that receive floor action in the House are called up and considered under suspension of the rules. The suspension procedure allows nonprivileged measures to be raised without a special rule, waives points of order, limits debate, and prohibits floor amendments. Motions to suspend the rules and pass the measure require a two-thirds vote, so the procedure is typically reserved for bills and resolutions that can meet a supermajority threshold. Decisions to schedule bills for consideration under suspension are generally based on how widely supported the measures are, how long Members wish to debate them, and whether they want to propose floor amendments. These decisions are not necessarily related to the subject matter of the measure. Accordingly, measures brought up under suspension cover a wide range of policy areas but most often address government operations, such as the designation of federal facilities. This report describes the suspension procedure, which is defined in clause 1 of House Rule XV, and provides an analysis of measures considered under suspension during the 114th Congress (2015-2016).",
    "crs_R44572": "Electronic warfare (EW)\u2014sometimes also called electromagnetic maneuver warfare (EMW)\u2014is a component of modern warfare, particularly in response to threats posed by technologically sophisticated potential adversaries such as Russia and China. EW generally refers to operations that use the electromagnetic spectrum (i.e., the \"airwaves\") to detect, listen to, jam, and deceive enemy radars, radio communication systems and data links, and other electronic systems. It also refers to operations for defending against enemy attempts to do the same. More formally, DOD defines electronic warfare as \"military action involving the use of electromagnetic and directed energy to control the electromagnetic spectrum or to attack the enemy.\" EW emerged in the early and middle decades of the 20th century with the invention and spread of radio and radar and their use in military operations. It therefore predate cyberwarfare, which emerged decades later with the invention and spread of computers and the internet. Today some overlap exists between EW and cyberwarfare, though there is a key difference between the two. EW focuses on military operations that use the electromagnetic spectrum against radars and radio communication and data links, while cyberwarfare activities\u2014which occur on a day-to-day basis as well as during overt conflicts\u2014target computers and servers, and involve significant use of the wired connections between them. EW aircraft play a role in helping to ensure the combat survivability and effectiveness of other aircraft and friendly forces on the ground. EW aircraft detect and jam enemy radars and air defense command-and-control equipment, so that U.S. fighters, strike fighters, attack aircraft, and bombers can more safely penetrate enemy airspace. EW aircraft support the Navy's Naval Integrated Fires Counter-Air (NIF-CA) concept and help ensure the combat survivability and effectiveness of less stealthy, earlier-generation U.S. aircraft and friendly forces on the ground. EW aircraft are relatively few in number compared with the number of U.S. fighters, strike fighters, and attack aircraft, but they play a role in helping to ensure the combat survivability and effectiveness of other aircraft and friendly forces on the ground.

Since the early 1990s, Cambodia has been a major contributor to the United States, and the United States has provided assistance to Cambodia in various ways. In recent years, the United States has imposed conditions upon some U.S. assistance to Cambodia in order to promote democracy and human rights in the Kingdom. From 1998 to 2007, Congress prohibited government-to-government assistance to Cambodia in order to pressure Hun Sen into fully instituting democracy, but allowed U.S. assistance to nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) and some humanitarian programs to continue. Congress lifted the ban in 2007 due in part to improving democratic processes, although most U.S. assistance efforts in Cambodia continue to be channeled through NGOs. The 115th Congress (2017-2018) took numerous steps in response to Hun Sen's recent suppression of the opposition, which include the following: In November 2017, the Trump Administration withdrew $1.8 million in assistance to the National Election Committee (NEC). On December 12, 2017, the Subcommittee on Asia and the Pacific of the House Committee on Foreign Affairs held a hearing on U.S. policy options to promote democracy and human rights in Cambodia. On November 16, 2017, the Senate passed S.Res. 279, urging the Department of the Treasury to consider blocking the assets of senior Cambodian government officials implicated in the suppression of democracy and human rights abuses. In December 2017, the Trump Administration announced that it would \"restrict entry into the United States of those individuals involved in undermining democracy in Cambodia.\" In August 2018, in response to the National Assembly election, the Administration announced that it would \"expand\" the restrictions.

PBGC runs two distinct insurance programs: one for single-employer pension plans and a second for multiemployer plans. Single-employer pension plans are sponsored by one employer and cover eligible workers employed by the plan sponsor. Multiemployer plans are collectively bargained plans to which more than one company makes contributions. PBGC maintains separate reserve funds for each program. In FY2018, PBGC insured about 25,000 DB pension plans covering about 37 million people. It paid or owed benefits to 1.4 million people. PBGC is the trustee of 4,919 single-employer plans. PBGC provided financial assistance to 78 multiemployer pensions. PBGC pays a maximum benefit to plan participants. Most workers in single-employer plans taken over by PBGC and multiemployer plans that receive financial assistance from PBGC receive the full pension benefit that they earned. However, among participants in multiemployer plans that were terminated and likely to need financial assistance in the future, 49% have a benefit below the PBGC maximum guarantee and 51% have a benefit larger than the PBGC maximum guarantee. PBGC's single-employer and multiemployer insurance programs operate differently and PBGC maintains separate reserve funds for each program. Funds from the reserve of one program may not be used for the other program. In the single-employer program, PBGC becomes the trustee of the terminated, underfunded single-employer DB pension plans. The assets of the terminated plan are placed in a trust fund operated by PBGC. The participants in the trusteed plans receive their benefits from PBGC. In the multiemployer program, PBGC does not become the trustee of plans. PBGC makes loans to multiemployer DB pension plans when the plans become insolvent.

Medicare serves approximately one in six Americans and virtually all of the population aged 65 and over. In calendar year (CY) 2019, the program is expected to cover about 61 million persons (52 million aged and 9 million disabled) at a total cost of about $798 billion, accounting for approximately 3.8% of gross domestic product. The Medicare program is administered by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) within the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), and individuals enroll in Medicare through the Social Security Administration (SSA). Medicare consists of four parts\u2014Parts A through D. Part A covers hospital services, skilled nursing facility services, home health visits, and hospice services. Part B covers a broad range of medical services and supplies, including physician services, laboratory services, durable medical equipment, and outpatient hospital services. Enrollment in Part B is voluntary; however, most Medicare beneficiaries (about 91%) are enrolled in Part B. Part C (Medicare Advantage) provides private plan options, such as managed care, for beneficiaries who are enrolled in both Part A and Part B. Part D provides optional outpatient prescription drug coverage. Each part of Medicare is funded differently. Part A is financed primarily through payroll taxes imposed on current workers (2.9% of earnings, shared equally between employers and workers), which are credited to the Hospital Insurance (HI) Trust Fund. Beginning in 2013, workers with annual wages over $200,000 for single tax filers or $250,000 for joint filers pay an additional 0.9%. Beneficiaries generally do not pay premiums for Part A. In 2019, total Part A expenditures are expected to reach about $328 billion, representing about 41% of program costs. Part B premiums are normally set at a rate each year equal to 25% of average expected per capita Part B program costs for the aged for the year. Higher-income enrollees pay higher premiums set to cover a greater percentage of Part B costs, while those with low incomes may qualify for premium assistance through one of several Medicare Savings Programs administered by Medicaid.

This report identifies and categorizes uses of the Capitol Rotunda and Capitol Grounds authorized by concurrent resolutions since the 101st Congress. In most cases, use of the Capitol Rotunda requires a concurrent resolution agreed to by both the House and Senate. A concurrent resolution for the use of the Rotunda typically identifies the event and date for which use is authorized. Often the resolution also directs physical preparations to be carried out \"in accordance with such conditions as the Architect of the Capitol may provide.\" Use of the Capitol Grounds requires either the passage of a concurrent resolution or permit approval from the Capitol Police. Events that entail the use of the West Front Steps of the Capitol, electricity on the Lower West Terrace of the Capitol, require more than 24 hours from setup to cleanup, require vehicles on Capitol Grounds for setup, or will have a large number of Members in attendance typically require a concurrent resolution.

He is now being investigated for corruption himself. During the election campaign, as mass protests calling for then-President P\u00e9rez Molina's resignation and an end to corruption and impunity grew, so did Morales' popular appeal. Morales framed his lack of political experience as an asset. His campaign slogan was \"Neither corrupt nor a thief.\" He won Guatemala's 2015 presidential election by a landslide with 67% of the vote. Morales initially supported the International Commission against Impunity in Guatemala (CICIG), which Guatemala asked the United Nations (U.N.) to form in 2007 to help the government combat corruption, human rights violations, and other crimes. After he became a target of investigations, he said he would not renew their mandate, which ends in September 2019. The President tried to terminate CICIG early unilaterally. Many observers are concerned that Morales' efforts could undermine ongoing investigations by the Guatemalan attorney general's office and judicial proceedings, make political reform more difficult, and heighten instability in Guatemala. The Guatemalan Congress is also moving legislation that, if passed, would reverse progress made in holding government officials and others accountable for corruption and crimes against humanity. Guatemala faces many political and social challenges in addition to widespread corruption and impunity. Guatemala has some of the highest levels of violence, inequality, and poverty in the region, as well as the largest population. Indigenous people, about half of the population, experience higher rates of economic and social marginalization than nonindigenous citizens, and have for centuries. Almost half of the country's children are chronically malnourished. Guatemala's homicide rate decreased to 26.1 per 100,000 in 2017, which nonetheless remains one of the highest rates in the region.

    "crs_RS20348": "The interval during a fiscal year when appropriations for a particular project or activity are not enacted into law, either in the form of a regular appropriations act or a continuing resolution (CR), is referred to as a funding gap or funding lapse. Although funding gaps may occur at the start of the fiscal year, they may also occur any time a CR expires and another CR (or the relevant regular appropriations bill) is not enacted immediately thereafter. Multiple funding gaps may occur within a fiscal year. In 1980 and early 1981, then-Attorney General Benjamin Civiletti issued opinions in two letters to the President that have been put into effect through guidance provided to federal agencies under various Office of Management and Budget (OMB) circulars clarifying the limits of federal government activities upon the occurrence of a funding gap. The Civiletti letters state that, in general, the Antideficiency Act requires that if Congress has enacted no appropriation beyond a specified period, the agency may make no contracts and obligate no further funds except as \"authorized by law.\" In addition, because no statute generally permits federal agencies to incur obligations without appropriations for the pay of employees, the Antideficiency Act does not, in general, authorize agencies to employ the services of their employees upon a lapse in appropriations, but it does permit agencies to fulfill certain legal obligations connected with the orderly termination of agency operations. As a consequence of these guidelines, when a funding gap occurs, executive agencies begin a shutdown of the affected projects and activities, including the furlough of non-excepted personnel. The general practice of the federal government after the shutdown has ended has been to retroactively pay furloughed employees for the time they missed, as well as employees who were required to come to work. Under current practice, although a shutdown may be the result of a funding gap, the two events should be distinguished. This is because a funding gap may result in a shutdown of all affected projects or activities in some instances but not in others. For example, when a funding gap is of a short duration, agencies may not have enough time to complete a shutdown of affected projects and activities before funding is restored.

It also serves as an important forum for resolving trade disputes. The United States was a major force behind the establishment of the WTO in 1995 and the rules and agreements that resulted from the Uruguay Round of multilateral trade negotiations (1986-1994). The WTO encompassed and expanded on the commitments and institutional functions of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), which was established in 1947 by the United States and 22 other nations. Through the GATT and WTO, the United States and other countries sought to establish a more open, rules-based trading system in the postwar era, with the goal of fostering international economic cooperation, stability, and prosperity worldwide. Today, the vast majority of world trade, approximately 98%, takes place among WTO members. The evolution of U.S. leadership in the WTO and the institution's future agenda have been of interest to Congress. The terms set by the WTO agreements govern the majority of U.S. trading relationships. Some 65% of U.S. global trade is with countries that do not have free trade agreements (FTAs) with the United States, including China, the European Union (EU), India, and Japan, and thus rely on the terms of WTO agreements. Congress has recognized the WTO as the \"foundation of the global trading system\" within U.S. trade legislation and plays a direct legislative and oversight role over WTO agreements. U.S. FTAs also build on core WTO agreements. While the U.S. Trade Representative (USTR) represents the United States at the WTO, Congress holds constitutional authority over foreign commerce and establishes U.S. trade negotiating objectives and principles and implements U.S. trade agreements through legislation. U.S. priorities and objectives for the GATT/WTO are reflected in trade promotion authority (TPA) legislation since 1974. Congress also has oversight of the USTR and other executive branch agencies that participate in WTO meetings and enforce WTO commitments. The WTO's effectiveness as a negotiating body for broad-based trade liberalization has come under intensified scrutiny, as has its role in resolving trade disputes",
    "crs_95-563": "A complicated body of rules, precedents, and practices governs the legislative process on the floor of the House of Representatives. The official manual of House rules is more than 1,000 pages long and is supplemented by 30 volumes of precedents, with more volumes to be published in coming years. Yet there are two reasons why gaining a fundamental understanding of the House's legislative procedures is not as difficult as the sheer number and size of these documents might suggest. First, the ways in which the House applies its rules are largely predictable, at least in comparison with the Senate. Some rules are certainly more complex and more difficult to interpret than others, but the House tends to follow similar procedures under similar circumstances. Second, underlying most of the rules that Representatives may invoke and the procedures the House may follow is a fundamentally important premise\u2014that a majority of Members should ultimately be able to work their will on the floor. Although House rules generally recognize the importance of permitting any minority\u2014partisan or bipartisan\u2014to present its views and sometimes propose its alternatives, the rules do not enable that minority to filibuster or use other parliamentary devices to prevent the majority from prevailing without undue delay. This principle provides an underlying coherence to the various specific procedures discussed in this report. The House rules for each Congress are published in a volume often called the House manual but officially entitled Constitution, Jefferson's Manual and Rules of the House of Representatives. A new edition of this collection is published each Congress. Volume 1 of a fourth series of House precedents, Precedents of the United States House of Representatives, was initiated in 2017, and additional volumes are expected in the future. The House's procedures are summarized in House Practice: A Guide to the Rules, Precedents, and Procedures of the House, by Charles W. Johnson, John V. Sullivan, and Thomas J. Wickham Jr., Parliamentarians of the House. The most recent version of House Practice was published in 2017.

It was created in 1996 as part of P.L. 104-121, the Contract with America Advancement Act of 1996 (Title II, the Small Business Regulatory Enforcement Fairness Act of 1996 [SBREFA]). It is a relatively small office, with authorization for up to seven employees. It currently has five employees: a Deputy National Ombudsman (Mina Wales), an administrative officer, an external outreach manager, and two case management specialists. The National Ombudsman position, which is currently vacant, is appointed by the SBA Administrator. The Office of the National Ombudsman's primary purpose is to provide small businesses, small government entities (those serving populations of less than 50,000), and small nonprofit organizations that believe they have experienced unfair or excessive regulatory compliance or enforcement actions (such as repetitive audits or investigations, excessive fines, and retaliation by federal agencies) a means to comment about such actions. As an impartial liaison, the Office of the National Ombudsman \"directs reported regulatory fairness matters to the appropriate agency for high-level fairness review, and works across government to address those concerns, reduce regulatory burdens, and help small businesses succeed.\" SBREFA also created a five-person Small Business Regulatory Fairness Board in each of the SBA's 10 regions to advise the National Ombudsman on matters related to federal regulatory enforcement activities affecting small businesses. Specifically, SBREFA directs the SBA Administrator to designate an ombudsman to work with each federal agency with regulatory authority over small businesses to ensure that small businesses that receive or are subject to an audit, on-site inspection, compliance assistance effort, or other enforcement-related communication or contact by federal agency personnel are provided a means to comment on those regulatory compliance and enforcement activities; receive comments from small businesses regarding actions by federal agency employees conducting small business regulatory compliance or enforcement activities; refer comments to the affected federal agency's inspector general in appropriate circumstances and maintain the confidentiality of the person or small business making these comments; based on substantiated comments received from small businesses and Small Business Regulatory Fairness Boards, annually report to Congress and affected federal",

An intern is an individual who provides assistance, paid or unpaid, to a congressional office on a temporary basis. The internship experience is typically considered to provide an educational benefit for that individual. An intern's role does not substitute for or replace the duties of regular employees. If an intern is paid, then some of the rules applicable to congressional employees may apply. This report focuses on congressional interns, as described above, although their role can sometimes seem similar to individuals in the following positions: A volunteer also provides assistance to a congressional office, and the experience is generally considered to be of educational value for the volunteer.

    "crs_R41057": "The Small Business Administration (SBA) administers programs that support small businesses, including loan guarantees to lenders to encourage them to provide loans to small businesses \"that might not otherwise obtain financing on reasonable terms and conditions\" and grants to nonprofit organizations to provide marketing, management, and technical training assistance to small business owners. Historically, one of the justifications presented for funding the SBA's loan guarantee programs has been that small businesses can be at a disadvantage, compared with other businesses, when trying to obtain access to sufficient capital and credit. It has been argued that this disadvantage is particularly acute for startups and microbusinesses (firms with fewer than five employees): Traditional lending institutions, such as banks and investors, are unlikely to offer loans and investment capital to microfirms due to a variety of reasons. One barrier to microlending is a concern that startups and smaller enterprises are risky investments since growing businesses typically exhibit erratic bursts of growth and downturn. Another issue is that microbusinesses by and large require smaller amounts of capital, and thus banks or investment companies often believe that it is not efficient use of their time or resources, nor will they receive a substantive return on investment from such a small loan amount. The SBA's Microloan lending program was authorized initially as a five-year demonstration project. It was made permanent, subject to reauthorization, in 1997 (P.L. 105-135, the Small Business Reauthorization Act of 1997). Congressional interest in the Microloan program has increased in recent years, primarily because microloans are viewed as a means to assist very small businesses, especially women- and minority-owned startups, obtain loans that enable them to create jobs. Job creation and preservation, always a congressional interest, has taken on increased importance given continuing concerns about job growth. This report describes the Microloan program's eligibility standards and operating requirements for lenders and borrowers and examines the arguments presented by the program's critics and advocates.

Some of these programs provide emergency assistance to people affected by conflict or natural disaster. Other programs provide nonemergency assistance to address chronic poverty and hunger, such as providing food to people during a seasonal food shortage or training parents and community health workers in nutrition. Current international food assistance programs originated in 1954 with the passage of the Food for Peace Act (P.L. 83-480), also referred to as P.L. 480. Historically, the United States has provided international food assistance primarily through in-kind id, which ships U.S. commodities to countries in need. Congress funds in-kind food aid programs through the Agriculture, Rural Development, Food and Drug Administration, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act\u2014known as the Agriculture appropriations bill. In 2010, Congress established the Emergency Food Security Program (EFSP), which provides primarily cash-based food assistance. Cash-based assistance provides recipients with the means to acquire food, including through cash transfers, vouchers, or locally and regionally procured food\u2014food purchased in the country or region where it is to be distributed rather than from the United States. Congress funds EFSP through the International Disaster Assistance (IDA) account in the State, Foreign Operations, and Related Programs (SFOPS) appropriations bill. The IDA account also funds nonfood emergency humanitarian assistance, such as provision of shelter and health services. The FY2018 and FY2019 Agriculture Appropriations Acts provided funding for U.S. international food aid programs in the Foreign Assistance and Related Programs (Title V) and General Provisions (Title VII) titles. This included funding for FFP Title II and McGovern-Dole. The acts also provided funding for administrative expenses to manage existing FFP Title I loans that originated while the FFP Title I program was active. The FY2019 act also provided funding for the Food for Progress program, which typically receives only mandatory funding. The FY2018 Agriculture Appropriations Act (Division A of P.L. 115-141) provided $1.924 billion for international food aid programs, a 7% increase from the FY2017 enacted total of $1.802 billion.

Title II contains appropriations and administrative provisions for the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). Title III, Related Agencies, currently funds 23 agencies in other departments, such as the Forest Service in the Department of Agriculture and the Indian Health Service in the Department of Health and Human Services; arts and cultural agencies, including the Smithsonian Institution; and various other organizations and entities. Title III also contains administrative provisions for some agencies funded therein. For FY2019, the enacted appropriation for Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies was $35.61 billion. This total was composed of $13.02 billion for DOI agencies in Title I, $8.06 billion for EPA in Title II, $13.74 billion for \"Related Agencies\" in Title III, and $791.0 million in Title IV for certain activities of EPA. The FY2019 appropriation was $300.0 million (0.8%) more than the FY2018 regular appropriation of $35.31 billion, but $975.4 million (2.7%) less than the FY2018 total appropriation of $36.59 billion, including $1.28 billion in emergency supplemental appropriations for disaster relief.

Because the FY2019 appropriation was not enacted until February 15, 2019, Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies received continuing appropriations for certain periods before that date. Specifically, from the start of the fiscal year on October 1, 2018, through December 21, 2018, continuing appropriations were provided at the FY2018 level (in Division G of P.L. 115-141).

The changing dynamics and composition of international trade and finance can affect the overall health of the U.S. economy, the success of U.S. businesses and workers, and the U.S. standard of living. They also have implications for U.S. geopolitical interests. Conversely, geopolitical tensions, risks, and opportunities can have major impacts on international trade and finance. These issues are complex and at times controversial, and developments in the global economy often make policymaking more challenging. Congress is in a unique position to address these and other issues given its constitutional authority for legislating and overseeing international commerce. The major focus of the 115th Congress was overseeing the Trump Administration's evolving trade policy. The Trump Administration's approach to international trade arguably represents a significant shift from the approaches of prior administrations, in that it questions the benefits of U.S. leadership in the rules-based global trading system and expresses concern over the potential limits that this system may place on U.S. sovereignty. As such, the Administration's withdrawal from the proposed Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP), imposition of unilateral trade restrictions on various U.S. imports, renegotiation of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), modification of certain provisions in the U.S.-South Korea (KORUS) free trade agreement (FTA), and launch of an extensive review of U.S. participation in the World Trade Organization (WTO) were among the most notable developments in U.S. trade policy in the past two years. Other issues before Congress included approving legislation to (1) strengthen the process used to review the national security implications of foreign direct investment transactions in the United States; (2) modernize U.S. development finance tools to help advance U.S. national security and economic interests and global influence; and (3) provide temporary tariff suspensions and reductions\u2014through Miscellaneous Tariff Bills\u2014on certain products not available domestically.

While the nature of lawmakers' interest in bank regulation has shifted over time, most bank regulations fall into one of three general categories. First, banks must abide by a variety of safety-and-soundness requirements designed to minimize the risk of their failure and maintain macroeconomic stability. Second, banks must comply with consumer protection rules intended to deter abusive practices and provide consumers with complete information about financial products and services. Third, banks are subject to various reporting, recordkeeping, and anti-money laundering requirements designed to assist law enforcement in investigating criminal activity. The substantive content of these requirements remains the subject of intense debate. However, the division of regulatory authority over banks between the federal government and the states plays a key role in shaping that content. In some cases, federal law displaces (or \"preempts\") state bank regulations. In other cases, states are permitted to supplement federal regulations with different, sometimes stricter requirements. Because of its substantive implications, federal preemption has recently become a \"flashpoint\" in debates surrounding bank regulation, with one commentator observing that preemption is \"[t]he issue at the center of most disputes between state and federal banking regulators.\" This report provides an overview of banking preemption. First, the report discusses general principles of federal preemption. Second, the report provides a brief history of the American \"dual banking system.\" Third, the report discusses the Supreme Court's decision in Barnett Bank of Marion County, N.A. v.

Certain trade agreements negotiated by the President, such as agreements that reduce barriers to trade in ways that require changes in U.S. law, must be approved and implemented by Congress through legislation. If the content of the implementing bill and the process of negotiating and concluding it meet certain requirements, TPA ensures time-limited congressional consideration and an up-or-down vote with no amendments. In order to be eligible for this expedited consideration, a trade agreement must be negotiated during the limited time period for which TPA is in effect, and must advance a series of U.S. trade negotiating objectives specified in the TPA statute. In addition, the negotiations must be conducted in conjunction with an extensive array of required notifications to and consultations with Congress and other public and private sector stakeholders. Finally, the President must submit to Congress a draft implementing bill, which must meet specific content requirements, and a range of supporting information. If, in any given case, Congress judges that these requirements have not been met, TPA provides mechanisms through which the implementing bill may be made ineligible for expedited consideration. More generally, TPA defines how Congress has chosen to exercise its constitutional authority over a particular aspect of trade policy, while affording the President added leverage and credibility to negotiate trade agreements by giving trading partners assurance that final agreements can receive consideration by Congress in a timely manner and without amendments.

The act provides a significant degree of protection from foreign competition for U.S. shipyards, domestic carriers, and American merchant sailors. It is a subject of debate because some experts point out that it makes domestic ocean shipping relatively expensive, constrains the availability of ships, and contributes to making it much more costly to build merchant vessels in U.S. shipyards than in shipyards abroad. The Jones Act has been an issue in recent Congresses, coming into prominence amid debates over Puerto Rico's economic challenges and recovery from Hurricane Maria in 2017; in the investigation into the sinking of the 40-year-old ship El Faro with 33 fatalities during a hurricane in 2015; and in discussions about domestic transportation of oil and natural gas. The law's effectiveness in achieving national security goals has also been the subject of attention in conjunction with a congressional directive that the Administration develop a national maritime strategy, including strategies to increase the use of short sea shipping and enhance U.S. shipbuilding capability. In May 2018, the Office of Management and Budget requested public comment on federal requirements that could be modified or repealed to increase efficiency and reduce or eliminate unnecessary or unjustified regulatory burdens in the maritime sector.

    "crs_R45719": "A growing number of Americans report that they use marijuana. As more states decriminalize the use of marijuana, the question of what impact marijuana usage has on the risk of a driver being involved in a motor vehicle crash has become more pertinent. In a survey, the majority of state highway safety offices rated drugged driving an issue at least as important as driving while impaired by alcohol. When faced with the issue of driver impairment due to marijuana, some stakeholders tend to approach the issue using the analogy of driver impairment due to alcohol. However, there are important differences between the two substances. The fact that alcohol reduces a user's ability to think clearly and to perform physical tasks has been known for decades. Extensive research has established correlations between the extent of alcohol consumption and impairment, including drivers' reaction times. Much less research has been done on marijuana. Marijuana is a more complex substance than alcohol. It is absorbed in the body differently from alcohol; it affects the body in different ways from alcohol; tests for its presence in the body produce more complicated results than tests for the presence of alcohol; and correlating its effects with its levels in the body is much more complicated than for alcohol. That marijuana usage increases a driver's risk of crashing is not clearly established. Studies of marijuana's impact on a driver's performance have thus far found that, while marijuana usage can measurably affect a driver's performance in a laboratory setting, that effect may not translate into an increased likelihood of the driver being involved in a motor vehicle crash in a real-world setting, where many other variables affect the risk of a crash. Some studies of actual crashes have estimated a small increase in the risk of crash involvement as a result of marijuana usage, while others have estimated little or no increase in the likelihood of a crash from using marijuana. This CRS report addresses various aspects of the issue of marijuana-impaired driving, including patterns of marijuana use, the relationship and detection of marijuana use and driver impairment, and related state law and law enforcement challenges.

Temporary Protected Status (TPS), codified by the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA), provides temporary relief from removal and work authorization to foreign nationals in the United States from countries experiencing armed conflict, natural disaster, or other extraordinary circumstances that prevent their safe return. TPS was established by Congress as part of the Immigration Act of 1990 (P.L. 101-649). The statute gives the Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security, in consultation with other government agencies (most notably the Department of State), the authority to designate a country for TPS under one or more of the following conditions: ongoing armed conflict in a foreign state that poses a serious threat to personal safety; a foreign state request for TPS because it temporarily cannot handle the return of its nationals due to an environmental disaster; or extraordinary and temporary conditions in a foreign state that prevent its nationals from safely returning. A foreign state may not be designated for TPS if the Secretary of DHS finds that allowing its nationals to temporarily stay in the United States is against the U.S. national interest. The Secretary of DHS can designate a country for TPS for periods of 6 to 18 months and can extend these periods if the country continues to meet the conditions for designation. In addition to TPS, there is another form of blanket relief from removal known as deferred enforced departure (DED), formerly known as extended voluntary departure (EVD). DED is a temporary, discretionary, administrative stay of removal granted to aliens from designated countries. Unlike TPS, a DED designation emanates from the President's constitutional powers to conduct foreign relations and has no statutory basis. DED was first used in 1990 and has been used a total of five times. Liberia is the only country currently designated under DED, and that designation is scheduled to end on March 30, 2020. The Administration has announced terminations of temporary protections for seven of these countries (six with TPS and one with DED). Several lawsuits have been filed challenging these decisions.

Its responsibilities fall into four main categories: monetary policy, provision of emergency liquidity through the lender of last resort function, supervision of certain types of banks and other financial firms for safety and soundness, and provision of payment system services to financial firms and the government. Congress has delegated responsibility for monetary policy to the Fed, but retains oversight responsibilities to ensure that the Fed is adhering to its statutory mandate of \"maximum employment, stable prices, and moderate long-term interest rates.\" The Fed has defined stable prices as a longer-run goal of 2% inflation\u2014the change in overall prices, as measured by the Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) price index. By contrast, the Fed states that \"it would not be appropriate to specify a fixed goal for employment; rather, the Committee's policy decisions must be informed by assessments of the maximum level of employment, recognizing that such assessments are necessarily uncertain and subject to revision.\" Monetary policy can be used to stabilize business cycle fluctuations (alternating periods of economic expansions and recessions) in the short run, while it mainly affects inflation in the long run. The Fed's conventional tool for monetary policy is to target the federal funds rate\u2014the overnight, interbank lending rate. The federal funds rate is linked to the interest rates that banks and other financial institutions charge for loans. Thus, whereas the Fed may directly influence only a very short-term interest rate, this rate influences other longer-term rates.

The department was assembled from components pulled from 22 different government agencies and began official operations on March 1, 2003. Since then, DHS has undergone a series of restructurings and reorganizations to improve its effectiveness. Although DHS does include many of the homeland security functions of the federal government, several of these functions or parts of these functions remain at their original executive branch agencies and departments, including the Departments of Justice, State, Defense, and Transportation. Not all of the missions of DHS are officially \"homeland security\" missions. Some DHS components have legacy missions that do not directly relate to conventional homeland security definitions, such as the Coast Guard, and Congress has in the past debated whether FEMA and its disaster relief and recovery missions belong in the department. For FY2019, the Trump Administration initially requested almost $75 billion in budget authority for DHS, including over $47 billion in adjusted net discretionary budget authority through the appropriations process. This included almost $7 billion to pay for the costs of major disasters under the Stafford Act. The Administration requested additional Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO) funding for the Coast Guard as a transfer from the U.S. Navy. Neither the Senate nor the House bill reported out of their respective appropriations committees in response to that request received floor consideration. Continuing appropriations expired on December 21, 2018, leading to a 35-day partial shutdown of federal government components without enacted annual appropriations\u2014including DHS. On February 15, the President signed into law P.L. 116-5, which included the FY2019 DHS annual appropriations act. The act included almost $56 billion in adjusted net discretionary budget authority, including $12 billion for the costs of major disasters, and $165 million for Coast Guard OCO funding. The current budget environment may present challenges to homeland security programs and DHS going forward.

Meanwhile, a recent lawsuit involving Maryland's university system has brought renewed attention to \"affirmative action\" in its other, original sense: the mandatory use of race by public higher education systems to eliminate the remnants of state-imposed racial segregation. This report addresses \"affirmative action\" in each of these two senses and discusses how the federal courts have analyzed them under the Fourteenth Amendment's guarantee of \"equal protection.\" The report first considers \"affirmative action\" in its original sense: the mandatory race-conscious measures that the federal courts have imposed on de jure segregated public university systems. The Supreme Court has made clear that a state that had a segregated system of education must eliminate all \"vestiges\" of that system, including through expressly race-conscious remedies. In its consequential 1992 decision United States v. Fordice, the Court charted a three-step inquiry for assessing whether a state has fulfilled that constitutional obligation, examining whether a current policy is traceable to the de jure segregated system, has continued discriminatory effect, and can be modified or practicably eliminated consistent with sound educational policy. Outside this de jure context, \"affirmative action\" has come to refer to a different category of race-conscious policies. These involve what the Court once called the \"benign\" use of racial classifications\u2014voluntary measures designed not directly to remedy past governmental discrimination, but to increase the representation of racial minorities previously excluded from various societal institutions. And in the context of higher education the Court has addressed one type of policy in particular: the use of race as a factor in admissions decisions, a practice now observed by many public and private colleges and universities.

To accomplish these goals, purposes of the law included \"providing funds\" for federal land acquisition and for federal assistance to states generally related to outdoor recreation. The LWCF is authorized to receive $900 million in revenues annually under the LWCF Act. Each year the fund accrues revenues at this level. The fund accumulates the majority of its revenues from oil and gas leases on the Outer Continental Shelf (OCS). It also accumulates revenues from the federal motorboat fuel tax and surplus property sales. However, revenues that accrue under the LWCF Act are available only if appropriated by Congress through the discretionary appropriations process. The LWCF receives additional revenue (beyond the $900 million) from OCS leasing under the Gulf of Mexico Energy Security Act of 2006 (GOMESA). Unlike revenues under the LWCF Act, GOMESA revenues are mandatory appropriations (and thus are not subject to annual appropriation by Congress). They can be used only for grants to states for outdoor recreation purposes. The overall level of annual appropriations (discretionary and mandatory combined) has varied widely since the fund's origin in FY1965. Of the total revenues that have accrued throughout the program's history ($40.9 billion), less than half have been appropriated ($18.9 billion) through FY2019. Thus, the unappropriated balance in the fund is estimated at $22.0 billion through FY2019. The LWCF Act outlines uses of the fund for federal and state purposes. It states that of the total made available to the fund, not less than 40% is to be used for \"federal purposes\" and not less than 40% is to be used to provide \"financial assistance to states.\" The act lists the federal purposes for which the President is to allot LWCF funds \"unless otherwise allotted in the appropriation Act making them available.\" These purposes primarily relate to the acquisition of lands and waters (and interests therein) by the federal government.

    "crs_R45700": "Disclosure provisions that require commercial actors to convey specified information to consumers occupy an uneasy and shifting space in First Amendment jurisprudence. The First Amendment's Free Speech Clause protects the right to speak as well as the right not to speak, and at least outside the context of commercial speech, courts generally disfavor any government action that compels speech. Indeed, the Supreme Court in 1943 described the First Amendment's protection against compelled speech as a \"fixed star in our constitutional constellation.\" Accordingly, government actions mandating speech are generally subject to strict scrutiny by courts, and will be upheld \"only if the government proves that they are narrowly tailored to serve compelling state interests.\" However, the Court has also long accepted a variety of laws that require commercial actors to make certain disclosures to consumers, confirming that Congress can compel certain disclosures, even those involving protected speech, without running afoul of the First Amendment. Commercial disclosure requirements have largely withstood constitutional scrutiny in part because, historically, commercial speech has received less protection under the First Amendment than other speech. The government's ability to more freely regulate commercial speech has been linked to its general authority \"to regulate commercial transactions.\" Thus, notwithstanding the fact that commercial disclosure requirements compel speech, courts generally have not analyzed such provisions under the strict scrutiny standard. Instead, courts have often employed less rigorous standards to evaluate such provisions. The precise nature of a court's First Amendment analysis, however, will depend on the character of the disclosure requirement at issue. In a recent decision, the Supreme Court distilled and explained its prior cases on this subject. First, the Court said that it has upheld some commercial disclosure requirements that target conduct and only incidentally burden speech. This rubric likely only applies if the disclosure provision is part of a larger scheme regulating commercial conduct. If the disclosure provision instead regulates \"speech as speech,\" it might be subject either to intermediate scrutiny, as a government regulation of commercial speech, or to something closer to rational basis review, if the disclosure provision qualifies for review under the Supreme Court's decision in Zauderer v. Office of Disciplinary Counsel. Some of the Court's recent cases, however, have suggested that in certain circumstances, disclosure requirements may be subject to heightened scrutiny.

Former U.S. military servicemembers may be eligible for unemployment benefits through the Unemployment Compensation for Ex-Servicemembers (UCX) program.

The lapse in federal appropriations that occurred from December 22, 2018, until January 25, 2019, caused a partial government shutdown. As a result, during this lapse in appropriations, agencies without funding furloughed federal employees, and many federal employees excepted from furlough were working without pay. Furloughed federal employees may be eligible for UCFE benefits. States are required to operate the UCFE program under the same terms and conditions that apply to regular state UC. Therefore, UCFE eligibility is determined under the laws of the state in which an individual's official duty station in federal civilian service is located. Federal employees who are in furlough status on account of a government shutdown are generally treated by state law as laid off with an expectation of recall. Depending on state laws and regulations, the state may have an option to not require federal employees to search for work given an expected recall.

However, concerns about the financial and social costs of an increasing prison population and what prisons are doing to rehabilitate prisoners and prevent recidivism have led some policymakers to consider whether some of the \"tough on crime\" policies of the 1980s and 1990s need to be changed. Policymakers have started to reconsider whether prisoners should be prohibited from utilizing Pell Grants to participate in postsecondary education programs while they are incarcerated. Legislation was introduced in the 115th and 116th Congresses that would have allowed incarcerated individuals to receive Pell Grants. As Senator Lamar Alexander noted \"most prisoners, sooner or later, are released from prison, and no one is helped when they do not have the skills to find a job.\" Making Pell grants available to them in the right circumstances is a good idea.\" In addition, both the Obama Administration and Trump Administration recommended expanding Pell Grants or other targeted federal financial aid to prisoners who are eligible for release after serving a period of incarceration.

The report states that the United States does not need to deploy \"non-strategic nuclear capabilities that quantitatively match or mimic Russia's more expansive arsenal.\" But it indicates that \"expanding flexible U.S. nuclear options now, to include low yield options, is important for the preservation of credible deterrence against regional aggression.\" The NPR's recommended deployment of U.S. nonstrategic nuclear weapons follows growing concerns, both in Congress and among analysts outside of government, about new nuclear challenges facing the United States.

Originally intended as a reserve to replace oil that might be withdrawn from the world market to forward political purposes and objectives, its rationale has evolved with the changing world oil market and the role of the United States in the market. In addition to replacing oil lost to political turmoil, as in Libya in 2011, in recent years it has been more commonly used to replace oil supplies curtailed due to natural disasters, mainly hurricanes. The effects of hurricanes, especially those of the magnitude of Katrina, Rita, and others, has threatened to disrupt oil production, refining, and distribution, creating potential economic dislocation. Use of oil from the SPR has helped to minimize the economic effect of those events. Since 2010, the oil market in the United States has been transformed. Low growth in petroleum product demand, rapidly increasing domestic oil production, and falling net imports of crude oil and petroleum products have reduced U.S. dependence on foreign oil suppliers. At the same time, export sources on the world market have expanded, reducing the ability of any one exporter, or group of exporters, to manipulate the market. As the U.S. oil position in the world oil market has strengthened, some have questioned whether the SPR should be either downsized to reflect current supply and demand balances, or even eliminated entirely. Since 2015, Congress has passed legislation which mandates the sale of SPR oil to fund a variety of government activities. For some, a question exists as to how much oil might be withdrawn from the Reserve while still maintaining an adequate oil \"safety net.\" Others question whether the evolving world oil market requires the United States to maintain any government-owned reserve holdings. Enacted legislation to date has mandated the sale of over 250 million barrels of oil from the SPR, a situation that brings up another policy issue.

The Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990 (OBRA90; P.L. 101-508), the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993 (OBRA93; P.L. 103-66), and the Economic Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2001 (EGTRRA; P.L. 107-16) collectively accelerated and extended the tax rate reductions enacted under EGTRRA through 2010. Under a last-minute agreement between President Obama and congressional leaders from both parties, Congress extended the Bush-era individual income tax cuts through 2012 under the Tax Relief, Unemployment Insurance Reauthorization, and Job Creation Act of 2010 (TRUC; P.L. 111-312). Facing the unwanted prospect of an across-the-board increase in all STRs, the 112th Congress permanently extended (through the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 [ATRA; P.L. 112-240]) each of the Bush-era STRs, with one exception: the top rate increased from 35% to 39.6%. Six years passed before Congress made another significant change in individual income tax rates. Through P.L. 115-97, often referred to as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, Congress temporarily reduced five of the seven individual income tax rates under prior law. For tax years beginning after December 31, 2017, and before January 1, 2026, individual income tax rates are 10%, 12%, 22%, 24%, 32%, 35%, and 37%; they are set to return to the levels that applied in 2017, for tax years beginning on or after January 1, 2026.

It also administers the Small Business Investment Company (SBIC) program. Authorized by P.L. 85-699, the Small Business Investment Act of 1958, as amended, the SBIC program is designed to \"improve and stimulate the national economy in general and the small-business segment thereof in particular\" by stimulating and supplementing \"the flow of private equity capital and long-term loan funds which small-business concerns need for the sound financing of their business operations and for their growth, expansion, and modernization, and which are not available in adequate supply.\" The SBIC program was created to address concerns raised in a Federal Reserve Board report to Congress that identified a gap in the capital markets for long-term funding for growth-oriented small businesses. The report noted that the SBA's loan programs were \"limited to providing short-term and intermediate-term credit when such loans are unavailable from private institutions\" and that the SBA \"did not provide equity financing.\" Equity financing (or equity capital) is money raised by a company in exchange for a share of ownership in the business. Ownership is represented by owning shares of stock outright or having the right to convert other financial instruments into stock. Equity financing allows a business to obtain funds without incurring debt, or without having to repay a specific amount of money at a particular time. The Federal Reserve Board's report concluded there was a need for a federal government program to \"stimulate the availability of capital funds to small business\" to assist these businesses in gaining access to long-term financing and equity financing. Facilitating the flow of capital to small businesses to stimulate the national economy was, and remains, the SBIC program's primary objective. The SBA does not make direct investments in small businesses. It partners with privately owned and managed SBICs licensed by the SBA to provide financing to small businesses with private capital the SBIC has raised (called regulatory capital) and with funds (called leverage) the SBIC borrows at favorable rates because the SBA guarantees the debenture (lo",

    "crs_RL33028": "The Social Security program pays benefits to retired or disabled workers and their family members and to the family members of deceased workers. As of March 2019, there were 63.3 million Social Security beneficiaries. Approximately 70% of those beneficiaries were retired workers and 13% were disabled workers. The remaining beneficiaries were the survivors of deceased insured workers or the spouses and children of retired or disabled workers. Social Security is financed primarily by payroll taxes paid by covered workers and their employers. The program is also credited with federal income taxes paid by some beneficiaries on a portion of their benefits, reimbursements from the General Fund of the Treasury for various purposes, and interest income from investments held by the Social Security trust funds. Social Security tax revenues are invested in U.S. government securities (special issues) held by the trust funds, and these securities earn interest. The tax revenues exchanged for the U.S. government securities are deposited into the General Fund of the Treasury and are indistinguishable from revenues in the General Fund that come from other sources. Because the assets held by the trust funds are U.S. government securities, the trust fund balance represents the amount of money owed to the Social Security trust funds by the General Fund of the Treasury. Funds needed to pay Social Security benefits and administrative expenses come from the redemption or sale of U.S. government securities held by the trust funds. The Secretary of the Treasury (the Managing Trustee of the Social Security trust funds) is required by law to invest Social Security revenues in securities backed by the U.S. government. The purchase of U.S. government securities allows any surplus Social Security revenues to be used by the federal government for other (non-Social Security) spending needs at the time. This trust fund financing mechanism allows the General Fund of the Treasury to borrow from the Social Security trust funds. In turn, the General Fund pays back the trust funds (with interest) when the trust funds redeem the securities. The process of investing Social Security revenues in securities and redeeming the securities as needed to pay benefits is ongoing. The Social Security trust funds are both designated accounts within the U.S. Treasury and the accumulated holdings of special U.S. government obligations. Both represent the funds designated to pay current and future Social Security benefits. The Social Security program is financed primarily by payroll taxes paid by covered workers and their employers.

All have permanent authorization, while the emergency loan program is the only one requiring a federal disaster designation. Most programs receive mandatory funding amounts of \"such sums as necessary\" and are not subject to annual discretionary appropriations. The Agricultural Improvement Act of 2018 (2018 farm bill, P.L. 115-334) made a number of amendments to these programs, generally to expand availability and support. Prior to the creation of many of the permanently authorized programs at USDA, Congress had historically provided farmers and ranchers with ad hoc disaster assistance payments authorized through supplemental appropriations. Subsequently, policies shifted away from the temporary forms of assistance in favor of enacting more permanent forms of support. More recently, policies have shifted to supplement permanent programs with ad hoc assistance for select agriculture losses. The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 (P.L. 115-123) amended existing disaster assistance programs and authorized $2.36 billion for production losses from hurricanes and wildfires in 2017 that were not covered by existing programs.

At that time, Congress determined that there were serious deficiencies in the executive branch's auditing and investigative activities designed to curb waste, fraud, and abuse and promote agency operational and program efficiency. OIGs were designed to provide Congress and federal agency heads independent, nonpartisan analysis, conducted in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards, to identify and recommend ways to limit waste, fraud, and abuse in federal programs and enhance operational and program efficiency and effectiveness. OIGs' activities were to supplement and complement those of the Government Accountability Office (GAO), which serves a similar, though not identical, role in assisting Congress fulfill its oversight function.

It provides an opportunity for Congress to choose how much support to provide for agriculture and nutrition and how to allocate it among competing constituencies. The farm bill has typically undergone reauthorization about every five years. The current farm bill\u2014the Agriculture Improvement Act of 2018 (P.L. 115-334, H.R. 2)\u2014was enacted in December 2018 and expires in 2023. From its beginning in the 1930s, farm bills have focused primarily on farm commodity programs to support a handful of staple commodities\u2014corn, soybeans, wheat, cotton, rice, dairy, and sugar. In recent decades, farm bills have expanded in scope to include a Nutrition title since 1973 and since then Conservation, Horticulture, Bioenergy, Credit, Research, and Rural Development titles. Budget matters increasingly influence the development of the farm bill. While other reports discuss policy issues, this report focuses on the budgetary effects across the whole farm bill. The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimates are the official measures when bills are considered and are grounded in long-standing budget laws and rules. The 2018 farm bill (the Agriculture Improvement Act of 2018, P.L. 115-334) was held to a budget-neutral position over its 10-year budget window. Some budget amounts were reallocated across programs within issue areas and across titles of the farm bill, as discussed throughout this report. The CBO baseline that was used to develop the 2018 farm bill was released in April 2018 (the first and sixth data columns in Table 1). It projected that if the 2014 farm bill were extended, as amended as of April 2018, farm bill programs would cost $426 billion over the next five years (FY2019-FY2023) and $867 billion over the next 10 years (FY2019-2028). Most of the 10-year amount, 77%, was in the Nutrition title for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP). The remaining 23%, $203 billion baseline, was for agricultural programs, mostly in crop insurance, farm commodity programs, and conservation. Other titles of the farm bill contributed about 1% of the baseline, some of which are funded primarily with discretionary spending.

The speakership election illustrates the main problem that confronts the minority leader: the subordinate status of the minority party in an institution noted for majority rule. As David Bonior, D-MI, explained: \"This body, unlike the other, operates under the principle that a determined majority should be allowed to work its will while protecting the rights of the minority to be heard.\" Minority party lawmakers are certain to be heard, but whether they will be heeded is sometimes another matter. Thus, the uppermost goal of any minority leader is to recapture majority control of the House. The minority leader is elected every two years by secret ballot of his or her party caucus or conference. These party leaders are typically experienced lawmakers when they win election to this position. The current minority leader, Kevin McCarthy, R-CA, served 12 years in the House, including as majority leader, prior to assuming his current role (a position he also held during his time in the California state assembly). Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-CA, served in the House for 16 years when she first became minority leader in the 108th Congress (2003-2004). Following her first tenure as Speaker from 2007 to 2010, Pelosi was again elected minority leader in the 112th Congress (2011-2012), at which point she was a 24-year veteran of the House.

In general, these programs were created (and amended over time) to both improve children's nutrition and provide support to the agriculture economy. Today, the child nutrition programs refer primarily to the following meal, snack, and milk reimbursement programs: National School Lunch Program (NSLP) (Richard B. Russell National School Lunch Act (42 U.S.C. 1751 et seq.)); School Breakfast Program (SBP) (Child Nutrition Act, Section 4 (42 U.S.C. 1773)); Child and Adult Care Food Program (CACFP) (Richard B.

The programs provide financial support and/or foods to the institutions that prepare meals and snacks served outside of the home (unlike other food assistance programs such as the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP, formerly the Food Stamp Program) where benefits are used to purchase food for home consumption). Though exact eligibility rules and pricing vary by program, in general the amount of federal reimbursement is greater for meals served to qualifying low-income individuals or at qualifying institutions, although most programs provide some subsidy for all food served. Participating children receive subsidized meals and snacks, which may be free or at reduced price. The programs are authorized under three major federal statutes: the Richard B.

Streamgages provide foundational information for diverse applications that affect a variety of constituents. Congress has supported a national streamgage program for 130 years. These streamgages operate in every state, the District of Columbia, and the territories of Puerto Rico and Guam; therefore, national streamgage operations garner interest from many Members of Congress. Data from streamgages inform real-time decisionmaking and long-term planning on issues such as hazard preparations and response, infrastructure design, water use allocations, ecosystem management, and recreation. Streamgages are operated across the globe with national programs in North America, Europe, Australia, and Brazil, among others. In the United States, the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), the Department of the Interior's (DOI's) lead scientific agency, manages the USGS Streamgaging Network. The network encompasses 10,300 streamgages that record water height or streamflow for at least a portion of the year. Approximately 8,200 of these streamgages measure streamflow year-round and are part of the National Streamflow Network. This subnetwork includes 3,640 Federal Priority Streamgages (FPSs), which Congress and the USGS designated as national priorities. Some entities, such as state governments, operate their own streamgages separate from the USGS Streamgaging Network. Congressional appropriations and agreements with approximately 1,400 nonfederal partners funded the USGS Streamgaging Network at $189.5 million in FY2018. Some streamgages are funded solely through congressional appropriations for the USGS and other federal agencies, such as the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE), Bureau of Reclamation (Reclamation), and Department of Defense (DOD).

    "crs_R42704": "Congress has considered several pieces of legislation that would change who would be eligible to receive the Purple Heart, and under what conditions. The wars in Iraq and Afghanistan have greatly increased the number of servicemembers receiving the Purple Heart award as well as the potential conditions under which they receive the award. Increasingly acknowledged conditions, such as traumatic brain injuries (TBI) and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), as well as accidents and other events while deployed, bring up new questions as to when a servicemember deserves a Purple Heart. The July 17, 2015, shooting of servicemembers at a Marine recruiting office and a naval reserve center in Chattanooga, TN, again prompted questions about applying the Purple Heart to terrorist attacks versus criminal acts. Veterans groups often voice their views when Congress or the President proposes making changes to expand eligibility for the Purple Heart. These groups argue, for example, that a servicemember who acquires PTSD may not always deserve the same recognition as a servicemember killed or wounded in direct combat, while others contend that these medical conditions can debilitate servicemembers just as much as physical injuries and can have lasting effects on servicemembers' lives. Determining which actions and events make a servicemember qualified for receiving a Purple Heart, and whether expanding eligibility does a disservice to those who have already earned the award, are contentious elements of this debate. Although Congress has traditionally left many military award requirements to the executive branch, the Constitution does allow Congress to act in this area, and events have prompted changes regarding eligibility for the Purple Heart. On December 19, 2014, Congress passed The Carl Levin and Howard P. \"Buck\" McKeon National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) for Fiscal Year 2015. Section 571 of the NDAA for FY2015 expanded eligibility by redefining what should be considered an attack by a \"foreign terrorist organization\" for purposes of determining eligibility for the Purple Heart. As a result, servicemembers wounded and killed in the 2009 shootings in Little Rock, AR, and at Fort Hood, TX, were awarded Purple Hearts in 2015. Congressional offices often receive questions about Purple Heart eligibility from constituents, especially when eligibility rules change. The number of these questions is likely to increase as servicemembers return from conflicts around the world and if eligibility requirements are again changed.

It has been a close ally of the Soviet Union since the end of the Cold War, and its economy has been largely state-controlled. Since the early 1960s, U.S. policy toward Cuba consisted largely of isolating the island nation through comprehensive economic sanctions, including an embargo on trade and financial transactions. In December 2014, President Obama announced a major shift in U.S. policy toward Cuba, moving away from a sanctions-based policy aimed at isolating Cuba toward a policy of engagement and a normalization of relations. The policy shift led to the restoration of diplomatic relations, the rescission of Cuba's designation as a state sponsor of international terrorism, and the easing of some restrictions on travel and commerce with Cuba. There was mixed reaction in Congress, with some Members of Congress supporting the change and others opposing it. Legislative initiatives in the 114th Congress reflected this policy divide, with some bills introduced that would have further eased U.S. economic sanctions and others that would have blocked the policy shift and introduced new sanctions. This report examines U.S. policy toward Cuba in the 115th Congress. It is divided into three major sections analyzing Cuba's political and economic environment; U.S. policy toward Cuba; and selected issues in U.S.-Cuban relations, including restrictions on travel and trade, funding for democracy and human rights projects in Cuba and for U.S. government-sponsored radio and television broadcasting, migration, antidrug cooperation, U.S. property claims, and U.S. fugitives from justice in Cuba.",

The act was the culmination of several years of congressional debate about what Congress might do to reduce the size of the federal prison population while also creating mechanisms to maintain public safety. Correctional and sentencing reform was an issue that drew interest from many Members of Congress. Some Members took it up for fiscal reasons; they were concerned that the increase in the Bureau of Prisons' (BOP) budget would take resources away from the Department of Justice's (DOJ) other priorities. Other Members were interested in correctional reform due to concerns about the social consequences (e.g., the effects incarceration has on employment opportunities and the families of the incarcerated, or the normalizing of incarceration) of what some deem mass incarceration, or they wanted to roll back some of the tough on crime policy changes that Congress put in place during the 1980s and early 1990s. This report provides an overview of the provisions of the First Step Act. The act has three major components: (1) correctional reform via the establishment of a risk and needs assessment system at BOP, (2) sentencing reform that involved changes to penalties for some federal offenses, and (3) the reauthorization of the Second Chance Act of 2007 (P.L. 110-199).

    "crs_R43542": "Social Security, which paid about $989 billion in benefits in 2018, is the largest program in the federal budget in terms of outlays. There are currently about 63 million Social Security beneficiaries. Most Social Security beneficiaries are retired or disabled workers, whose monthly benefits depend on their past earnings, their age, and other factors. Benefits are also paid to workers' dependents and survivors, based on the earnings of the workers upon whose work record they claim. Social Security has a significant impact on beneficiaries, both young and old, in terms of income support and poverty reduction. Under current law, Social Security's revenues are projected to be insufficient to pay full scheduled benefits after 2035. For both of those reasons, Social Security is of ongoing interest to policymakers. Most proposals to change Social Security outlays would change the benefit computation rules. Evaluating such proposals requires an understanding of how benefits are computed under current law. The first step of computing a benefit is determining a worker's average indexed monthly earnings (AIME), a measure of a worker's past earnings. The AIME is divided into three brackets (or segments) of earnings, which are divided by dollar amounts known as bend points. In 2019, the bend points are $926 and $5,583. Those amounts are indexed to the national average wage index, so they generally increase each year. Three factors, which are fixed by law at 90%, 32%, and 15%, are applied to the three brackets of AIME. For workers with AIMEs of $926 or less in 2019, the PIA is 90% of the AIME. Because the other two factors are lower, that share declines as AIMEs increase, which makes the benefit formula progressive. For workers who become eligible for retirement benefits, become disabled, or die in 2019, the PIA is determined as shown in the table below. The full retirement age (FRA, also called the normal retirement age) is the age at which a worker can receive the full PIA, increased by any cost-of-living adjustment (COLA). The FRA was 65 for people born before 1938, but the Social Security Amendments of 1983 (P.L. 98-21) raised the FRA for those born later, as shown in the table below.

Turkey's actions and statements on a number of foreign policy issues have contributed to problems with the United States and its other NATO allies, fueling concern about Turkey's commitment to NATO and Western orientation. For its part, Turkey may bristle because it feels like it is treated as a junior partner, and may seek greater foreign policy diversification through stronger relationships with more countries. Turkey's cooperation with countries whose respective interests may conflict involves a balancing act. Turkey's vulnerability to threats from Syria and Iraq increases the pressure on it to manage this balance. Involvement in Syria and Iraq by the United States, Russia, and Iran further complicates Turkey's situation. Additionally, grievances that President Recep Tayyip Erdogan and his supporters espouse against seemingly marginalized domestic foes (the military and secular elite who previously dominated Turkey, the Fethullah Gulen movement, Kurdish nationalists, and liberal activists) extend to the United States and Europe due to apparent suspicions of Western sympathies for these foes. Turkey's Middle Eastern profile expanded in the 2000s as Erdogan (while serving as prime minister) sought to build economic and political linkages\u2014often emphasizing shared Muslim identity\u2014with Turkey's neighbors. However, efforts to increase Turkey's influence and offer it as a \"model\" for other regional states appear to have been set back by a number of developments since 2011: (1) conflict and instability that engulfed the region and Turkey's own southern border, (2) Turkey's failed effort to help Muslim Brotherhood-aligned groups gain lasting power in Syria and North Africa, and (3) domestic polarization accompanied by government repression. Although Turkey shares some interests with traditional Sunni Arab powers Saudi Arabia and Egypt in countering Iran, these countries' leaders regard Turkey suspiciously because of the Turkish government's Islamist sympathies and close relationship with Qatar.

    "crs_R44296": "The Congressional Budget Act of 1974 (hereinafter referred to as the Budget Act) created the budget resolution and specifies that it be adopted annually. The budget resolution reflects an agreement between the House and Senate on spending and revenue levels. The budget resolution does not become law; therefore no money is spent or collected as a result of its adoption. Instead, it is meant to assist Congress in considering an overall budget plan. Once agreed to by both chambers in the exact same form, the budget resolution creates parameters that may be enforced in two primary ways: (1) by points of order, and (2) by using the budget reconciliation process. The budget resolution reflects an agreement between the House and Senate on a budgetary plan for the upcoming fiscal year. When the House and Senate do not reach final agreement on this plan, the budget process for the upcoming fiscal year may become complicated. Without an agreement on budgetary parameters, it may be more difficult for Congress to reach agreement on subsequent budgetary legislation, both within each chamber and between the chambers. If Congress agreed upon a budget resolution for the prior fiscal year, that resolution remains in effect and may provide some operative parameters, since a resolution includes multi-year enforceable levels. The usefulness of such levels may be limited, however, due to altered economic conditions and technical factors, not to mention any changes in congressional budgetary goals. Without agreement on a budget resolution, Congress also may not use the budget reconciliation process. This means that any budgetary changes to revenue or mandatory spending may not be considered under the special expedited procedures provided by the budget reconciliation process. In the absence of a budget resolution, other budget enforcement mechanisms are available to Congress comprising two general categories. First, there are types of budget enforcement that are entirely separate from the budget resolution, such as chamber rules and statutory spending caps. These mechanisms remain in effect in the absence of a budget resolution and place restrictions on certain types of budgetary legislation. Second, in the absence of agreement on a budget resolution, Congress may employ alternative legislative tools to serve as a substitute for a budget resolution. These substitutes are typically referred to as \"deeming resolutions,\" because they are deemed to serve in place of an agreement between the two chambers on an annual budget resolution for the purposes of establishing enforceable budget levels for the upcoming fiscal year (or multiple fiscal years).

    "crs_R45717": "The growth of the national debt, which is considered unsustainable under current policies, continues to be one of the central issues of domestic federal policymaking. This report examines alternative approaches to reducing annual budget deficits and decisions about how to bring the national debt under control over the long term. To do this, the report first examines historical trends in federal spending and revenue policy to illustrate both the challenges and trade-offs inherent to making choices between (1) limiting the provision of defense and domestic public goods, (2) reducing transfers to persons including entitlements for the elderly and those with low income, (3) reducing support for state and local governments, and (4) raising taxes. Using projections of the debt and deficit, the report then addresses how limiting reliance on one source of deficit reduction creates pressure on other sources. The federal government incurs a budget deficit when total spending exceeds revenues over the course of a fiscal year. Over the past 50 years, the federal government has, on average, run budget deficits of 2.9% of gross domestic product (GDP), though as seen in Figure 1, the amount has fluctuated from a surplus of 2.3% of GDP in 2000 to a deficit of 9.8% of GDP in 2009. A portion of the budget outcomes is a function of general economic conditions, and the remainder is a function of policy choices. For example, deficits tend to rise during recessions (through a combination of decreased revenues and increased spending on programs like unemployment), whereas the opposite is generally true during economic expansions. Policy choices, such as the decline in defense spending after the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991, may change the budget situation due to changes in national priorities. The accumulation of net deficits over time results in the federal debt. As shown in the table, the cumulative federal debt in 2018 was 78% of GDP. Of concern is that the federal budget deficit has resulted in the growth of the federal debt that has regularly exceeded the growth rate of the economy. The debt can grow without increasing the ratio of debt to GDP as long as it rises at a rate less than or equal to GDP growth. For example, if the debt is 80% of GDP and the economy is growing at 1.6%, a deficit of 1.28% of GDP (1.6% of 80%) will maintain the debt-to-GDP ratio. The FY2018 deficit is 4% of GDP\u2014a situation viewed by most",
    "crs_R45532": "The term digital economy has fluid meaning in different policy contexts. Broadly speaking, this term can refer to any number of everyday economic activities that are connected over computers, mobile phones, or other internet-connected devices. In the realm of international tax policy, though, certain types of activities and markets have been singled out for selective taxation by some jurisdictions\u2014primarily in Europe. Most of these digital economy business models operate in \"two-sided markets\" in which they provide services to individual users (sometimes at zero charge) and sell other services to businesses (e.g., advertising to users). Proponents of these \"digital services taxes\" (DSTs) justify them on a number of grounds, including the goal of having multinational corporations (MNCs) pay their \"fair share\" of taxes, taxing profits purportedly derived from consumers in their jurisdictions, or adapting traditional rules and systems of international taxation to account for new forms of \"disruptive\" business models that can be conducted virtually over the internet. U.S. opposition to these unilateral taxes has been voiced by several government officials. Robert Stack, while Treasury Deputy Assistant Secretary for International Tax Affairs under President Obama, said that such efforts are primarily political efforts to target U.S. corporations. More recently, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin has issued multiple statements in opposition to unilateral taxation of digital economy businesses. Some Members of the tax-writing committees in Congress have also criticized these efforts. This report analyzes DST proposals from an economic and policy perspective as they have been introduced, discussed, and adapted in European countries. Some commentators and policymakers argue that multinational corporations (MNCs) in the digital economy are \"undertaxed\" or are not paying a \"fair share\" of taxes in their jurisdictions. Two issues that often underlie these sentiments are (1) the ability of digital economy MNCs to provide services without establishing a physical presence (or \"permanent establishment\") in the country in which their customers reside and (2) the ability of digital economy MNCs to shift their profits away from countries where they conduct real economy activity (e.g., sales, development, production) toward low-tax jurisdictions where the MNCs are conducting little to no real economic activity. Even if a country is able to establish the right to tax an MNC's profits in the digital economy (",

And framing the policy debate are legal issues stemming from the existing federal framework of firearms laws and the constitutional constraints that may cabin Congress's ability to legislate in this area. Firearms regulation at the federal level has grown more expansive over time, setting rules for the lawful manufacture, sale, and possession of firearms at the national level. These federal firearms laws mostly serve as a baseline that states can (and sometimes do) supplement, and Congress regularly considers legislation to address perceived gaps in these laws. Proposals to modify the current federal framework for regulating firearms may be informed by numerous constitutional considerations, including the scope of the Second Amendment right to keep and bear arms and the need to ground legislation in one of Congress's enumerated powers.

In academic year (AY) 2016-2017, 6,760 institutions were classified as Title IV eligible IHEs. Of these IHEs eligible to participate in Title IV programs, approximately 29.4% were public institutions, 27.8% were private nonprofit institutions, and 42.9% were proprietary (or private, for-profit) institutions. It is estimated that $122.5 billion was made available to students through Title IV federal student aid in FY2017. To be able to receive Title IV assistance, students must attend an institution that is eligible to participate in the Title IV programs. IHEs must meet a variety of requirements to participate in the Title IV programs. First, an IHE must meet basic eligibility criteria, including offering at least one eligible program of education. In addition, an IHE must satisfy the program integrity triad, under which it must be legally authorized to provide a postsecondary education in the state in which it is located; accredited or preaccredited by an agency recognized by the Department of Education (ED) for such purposes, and certified by ED as eligible to participate in Title IV programs. The state authorization and accreditation components of the triad were developed independently to address the issues of quality assurance and consumer protection, and the federal government (ED specifically) generally relies on states and accrediting agencies to determine standards of educational program quality. The federal government's only direct role in determining Title IV eligibility is through the process of certification of eligibility and ensuring IHEs meet some additional Title IV requirements. Certification, as a component of the program integrity triad, focuses on an institution's fiscal responsibility and administrative capacity to administer Title IV funds. An IHE must fulfill a variety of other related requirements, including those that relate to institutional recruiting practices, student policies and procedures, and Title IV program administration. Finally, additional criteria may apply to an institution depending on its control or the type of educational programs it offers. For instance, proprietary institutions must derive at least 10% of their revenues from non-Title IV funds (also known as the 90/10 rule). Failure to fulfill some of these requirements does not necessarily end an IHE's participation in the Title IV programs, but may lead to additional oversight from ED",

    "crs_RL30478": "This report provides background information on the types of water supply and wastewater treatment projects traditionally funded by the federal government and the several existing programs to assist communities with water supply and wastewater treatment. For more than four decades, Congress has authorized and refined several programs to help communities address water supply and wastewater problems. The agencies that administer these programs differ in multiple ways. For example, in terms of funding mechanisms, projects developed by the Bureau of Reclamation (Reclamation) and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) typically require direct, individual project authorizations from Congress. In contrast, standing program authorizations provide project funding for other agencies, including the Department of Agriculture (USDA), the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the Department of Commerce, and the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD). The key practical difference is that with the individual project authorizations there is no predictable assistance, or even guarantee of funding after a project is authorized, because funding must be secured each year in the congressional appropriations process. The programs, on the other hand, have set program criteria, are generally funded from year to year, and provide a process under which project sponsors compete for funding. In terms of scope and mission, the primary responsibilities of USACE are to maintain inland navigation, provide for flood and storm damage reduction, and restore aquatic ecosystems, while EPA's mission relates to protecting public health and the environment. Further, the Department of Commerce and HUD focus on community and economic development. Likewise, the specific programs discussed in this report\u2014while all address water supply and wastewater treatment to some degree\u2014differ in important respects. Some are national in scope (those of USDA, EPA, and the Department of Commerce, for example), while others are regionally focused (Reclamation's programs and projects).

In practice, the trust funds invest solely in special, nonmarketable U.S. Treasury securities. By investing only in nonmarketable U.S. Treasury securities, or special issues, the trustees have not intervened directly in the private economy. Investing in marketable securities would signify a departure from the norms that govern the current investment practice. Investing in equities\u2014for example, by purchasing company stock in the open market\u2014would demonstrate a similar departure from the trust funds' investment norms and would represent a government intervention into the private market.

Among other factors, the age at which an individual begins receiving Social Security benefits has an impact on the size of the monthly benefits. Claiming benefits before the FRA can substantially reduce monthly benefits, whereas claiming benefits after the FRA can lead to a substantial increase in monthly benefits. Benefit adjustments are made based on the number of months before or after the FRA the worker claims benefits. The adjustments are intended to result in roughly the same total lifetime benefits, regardless of when the worker claims benefits, based on average life expectancy. The FRA was 65 at the inception of Social Security in the 1930s. As part of legislation enacted in 1983, the FRA is increasing gradually from 65 to 67 over a 22-year period that started for those who turned age 62 in 2000. The increase in the FRA will be fully phased in (the FRA will reach 67) for workers born in 1960 or later (i.e., for workers who become eligible for retirement benefits at age 62 in 2022). For workers who become eligible for retirement benefits in 2019 (i.e., workers born in 1957), the FRA is 66 and 6 months. Workers can claim Social Security retired-worker benefits as early as age 62, the early eligibility age (EEA). However, workers who claim benefits before the FRA are subject to a permanent reduction in their benefits. Spouses can also claim reduced retirement benefits as early as age 62. Other types of dependents can claim benefits before the age of 62. Workers who claim benefits after the FRA receive a delayed retirement credit that results in a permanent increase in their monthly benefits. The credit applies up to the age of 70.

At the time, the population living on the island was approximately 77% Greek ethnic origin and roughly 18% Turkish ethnic origin.

It required a Greek Cypriot president and a Turkish Cypriot vice president, each elected by his own community. Simultaneously, a Treaty of Guarantee signed by Britain, Greece, and Turkey ensured the new republic's territorial integrity, and a Treaty of Alliance between the republic, Greece, and Turkey provided for Greek and Turkish soldiers to help defend the island. However, at that time the two major communities aspired to different futures for Cyprus: most Greek Cypriots favored union of the entire island with Greece (enosis), whereas Turkish Cypriots preferred to partition the island (taksim) and possibly unite the Turkish Cypriot zone with Turkey. After the conflict subsided and a fragile peace took root, Turkish Cypriots pursued a solution to the conflict that would keep the two communities separate in two states under the government of either a confederation or a stronger central federal government.

Global development, a major objective of foreign aid, has been cited as a third pillar of U.S. national security, along with defense and diplomacy, in the national security strategies of the George W. Bush and Barack Obama Administrations. Although the Trump Administration's National Security Strategy does not explicitly address the status of development vis-\u00e0-vis diplomacy and defense, it does note the historic importance of aid in achieving foreign policy goals and supporting U.S. national interests. This report addresses a number of the more frequently asked questions regarding the U.S. foreign aid program; its objectives, costs, and organization; the role of Congress; and how it compares to those of other aid donors. It attempts not only to present a current snapshot of American foreign assistance, but also to illustrate the extent to which this instrument of U.S. foreign policy has evolved over time. Data presented in the report are the most current, consistent, and reliable figures available, generally updated through FY2017. Dollar amounts come from a variety of sources, including the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) Foreign Aid Explorer database (Explorer) and annual State, Foreign Operations, and Related Programs (SFOPS) appropriations acts. As new data are obtained or additional issues and questions arise, the report will be revised.",
    "crs_R45463": "The federal government collects various fees and other charges from businesses and households. Choosing to raise public funds via user fees, as opposed to other means such as taxes, has important administrative and economic consequences. Many fees stem from \"business-like activities,\" in which the government provides a service or benefit in return for payment. For example, many households charge entry fees, which then help fund maintenance projects. Some fees are closely tied to regulatory or judicial activities, such as filing or inspection fees, which stem from the federal government's sovereign powers. Other federal fees or charges are intragovernmental transactions that do not involve the public. For many federal agencies, fees or user charges amount to a minimal portion of budgetary resources. Other regulatory agencies, such as the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC), the Patent and Trademark Office (PTO), and the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), are wholly or partially funded by user fees and other nontax receipts. User fees from the public accounted for $331 billion in FY2017, about a tenth of total federal receipts ( $3.32 trillion). User fees from the public accounted for $331 billion in FY2017, about a tenth of total federal receipts ( $3.32 trillion). The statutory basis for each particular fee or user charge varies in specificity and in the degree of discretion granted to the executive branch. For example, authorizing legislation might specify in detail how certain fees are imposed and how proceeds are used. In other cases, federal agencies rely on broader authorities to impose user fees. User fees have several advantages as a means of financing public activities. They are voluntary, they connect the burden of financing activities to those who directly benefit from them, and they can help decentralize decisionmaking by bypassing centralized allocation of resources. At times, proposals to raise fees may encounter less political resistance than proposals to raise an equivalent sum via taxes. On the other hand, the flow of user fees and charges may reflect fluctuations in economic conditions, which may complicate the financing of government operations. Some are also concerned that funding arrangements may bypass regular congressional scrutiny and dilute Congress's power of the purse.",

Source s may vary in their totals due to differences in how federal workforce statistics are compiled. Some sources rely on \"head counts\" of employees (OPM), some on total hours worked (such as the Office of Management and Budget [OMB]), some on surveys of employing agencies, and others on self-identification by workers surveyed in their homes. In addition, federal civilian employee databases may exclude particular departments, agencies, or branches of government. Some may also account for temporary or seasonal employees (such as those employed by the U.S. Census) depending on the time of year the statistics are generated.

Protestants in Northern Ireland (48%) largely define themselves as British and support continued incorporation in the United Kingdom (unionists). Catholics in Northern Ireland (45%) consider themselves Irish, and many Catholics desire a united Ireland (nationalists). More militant unionists are often termed loyalists, while more militant nationalists are referred to as republicans; in the past, loyalists and republicans have been willing to use force to achieve their goals. The latest version of the Troubles was sparked in late 1968, when a civil rights movement was launched in Northern Ireland mostly by Catholics, who had long faced discrimination in areas such as electoral rights, housing, and employment. This civil rights movement was met with violence by some unionists, loyalists, and the police, which in turn prompted armed action by nationalists and republicans. Increasing chaos and escalating violence led the British government to deploy the British Army on the streets of Northern Ireland in 1969 and to impose direct rule from London in 1972 (between 1920 and 1972, Northern Ireland had its own regional government at Stormont, outside Belfast). For years, the British and Irish governments sought to facilitate a negotiated political settlement to the conflict in Northern Ireland. After many ups and downs, the two governments and the Northern Ireland political parties participating in the peace talks announced an agreement on April 10, 1998. This accord became known as the Good Friday Agreement (for the day on which it was concluded); it is also known as the Belfast Agreement. At the core of the Good Friday Agreement is the \"consent principle\"\u2014that is, a change in Northern Ireland's status can come about only with the consent of the majority of its people (as well as with the consent of a majority in Ireland). While the agreement acknowledged that a substantial section of the population in Northern Ireland and a majority on the island desired a united Ireland, it recognized that the majority of people in Northern Ireland wished to remain part of the UK. If the preferences of these majorities were to change, the agreement asserted that both the British and Irish governments would have a binding obligation to bring about the wish",
    "crs_R45618": "The International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) is one such example of a twentieth-century delegation of emergency authority. One of 123 emergency statutes under the umbrella of the National Emergencies Act (NEA), IEEPA grants the President extensive power to regulate a variety of economic transactions during a state of emergency. Congress enacted IEEPA in 1977 to rein in the expansive emergency economic powers that it had been delegated to the President under the Trading with the Enemy Act (TWEA). Nevertheless, some scholars argue that judicial and legislative actions subsequent to IEEPA's enactment have made it, like TWEA, a source of expansive and unchecked executive authority in the economic realm. Others, however, argue that Presidents often use IEEPA to implement the will of Congress either as directed by law or as encouraged by congressional activity. Until recently, there has been little congressional discussion of modifying either IEEPA or its umbrella statute, the NEA. Recent presidential actions, however, have drawn attention to presidential emergency powers under the NEA of which IEEPA is the most frequently used. Should Congress consider changing IEEPA, there are two issues that Congress may wish to address. The first pertains to how Congress has delegated its authority under IEEPA and its umbrella statute, the NEA. The second pertains to choices made in the Export Control Reform Act of 2018.

    "crs_R42565": "The Small Business Administration (SBA) administers several programs to support small businesses, including loan guaranty programs to enhance small business access to capital; venture capital programs, including the now inactive New Markets Venture Capital (NMVC) program, to foster small business expansion; programs to increase small business opportunities in federal contracting; direct loans for businesses, homeowners, and renters to assist their recovery from natural disasters; and access to entrepreneurial education to assist with business formation and expansion. Authorized by P.L. 106-554, the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2001 (Appendix H: the New Markets Venture Capital Program Act of 2000), the NMVC program is designed to promote economic development and the creation of wealth and job opportunities in low-income geographic areas and among individuals living in such areas by encouraging developmental venture capital investments in smaller enterprises primarily located in such areas; and address the unmet equity investment needs of small enterprises located in low-income geographic areas. Modeled on the SBA's Small Business Investment Company (SBIC) program, SBA-selected, privately owned and managed NMVC companies provide funding and operational assistance to small businesses. To do so, they use private capital the NMVC company has raised (called regulatory capital) and up to 150% of that amount (called leverage) from the sale of SBA-guaranteed 10-year debentures, or loan obligations, to third parties, subject to the availability of funds. Because the SBA guarantees the debenture, the SBA is able to obtain favorable interest rates. NMVC companies are responsible for meeting the terms and conditions set forth in the debenture. At least 80% of the investments must be in small businesses located in a low-income area, as defined in the statute. Specialized Small Business Investment Companies (SSBICs) established under the SBIC program are also eligible for NMVC operational assistance grants, which are awarded on a dollar-to-dollar matching basis. Six NMVC companies participated in the program. The NMVC program was appropriated $21.952 million in FY2001 to support up to $150 million in SBA-guaranteed debentures and up to $30 million for operational assistance grants for FY2001 through FY2006.

There is also a contingency fund available that provides extra federal funds to states that meet certain conditions. Additionally, states are required to expend a minimum amount of their own funds for TANF and TANF-related activities under what is known as the maintenance of effort (MOE) requirement. States are required to spend at least 75% of what they spent in FY1994 on TANF's predecessor programs.

    "crs_RL31693": "The President and Congress have historically played different roles when sending U.S. troops into hostile situations. The President has the power under Article II, Section 2, of the Constitution to use the Armed Forces to repel attacks. Congress under Article I, Section 8, has the power to declare war and raise and support the Armed Forces. The War Powers Resolution was enacted to ensure that the President and Congress share decisions where U.S. troops may become involved in hostilities. This sharing of power has often resulted in controversy, particularly when troops are sent into situations where there has not been a formal declaration of war. In most instances, Congress has used its legislative prerogatives through funding mechanisms or declarations of policy either to affirm or to place limits on presidential action. In three instances, Congress has authorized the use of military force in advance of hostilities: the Persian Gulf War (1991), military operations in Afghanistan (2001), and the \"use of force against Iraq\" resolution (2002). In each case, however, the President has maintained that while he may have sought congressional consultation and support, the President has the constitutional authority as Commander in Chief to use force, including the Armed Forces of the United States, to protect U.S. national security interests. Additionally, the executive branch has long viewed congressional enactment of defense appropriations bills as de facto authorization for operations funded under those measures, although Congress has often included provisions stating that no separate authorization for the use of force is implied by the appropriation of funds. This report describes the congressional debate that often surrounds the issue of employing the U.S. military abroad. Initially written in response to a congressional request for a list of votes on this topic from 1982-1992, this report has been updated as needed since that time.

President Maduro won reelection in early elections held in May 2018 that were dismissed as illegitimate by the United States, the European Union (EU), the G-7, and a majority of countries in the Western Hemisphere. U.S. relations with Venezuela, a major oil supplier, deteriorated during Ch\u00e1vez's rule, which undermined human rights, the separation of powers, and freedom of expression. U.S. and regional concerns have deepened as the Maduro government has manipulated democratic institutions; cracked down on the opposition, media, and civil society; engaged in drug trafficking and corruption; and refused most humanitarian aid. Efforts to hasten a return to democracy in Venezuela have failed thus far.

Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act (P.L. 93-288, hereinafter the Stafford Act) authorizes the President to issue a major disaster declaration in response to natural or man-made incidents that overwhelm state, local, or tribal capacities. The declaration makes a wide range of federal activities available to support state and local efforts to respond and recover from the incident. Major disaster declarations also authorize the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to provide grant assistance to state, local, and tribal governments, residences, and certain private nonprofit (PNP) facilities that provide critical services. Businesses that suffer uninsured loss as a result of a major disaster declaration are not eligible for FEMA grant assistance, and grant assistance from other federal sources is limited. On some occasions, Congress has provided assistance to businesses through the Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) program. The CDBG program provides loans and grants to eligible businesses to help them recover from disasters as well as grants intended to attract new businesses to the disaster-stricken area. In a few cases, CDBG has also been used to compensate businesses and workers for lost wages or revenues. CDBG assistance, however, is not available for all major disasters. Rather, it is used by Congress on a case-by-case basis in response to large-scale disasters. The United States Department of Agriculture and the Department of Commerce are also authorized to provide assistance to certain types of businesses such as agricultural producers or fisheries. While these programs are important sources of assistance following a disaster, they are generally limited in scope (available for only certain types of businesses) or provide limited grant amounts.

Its mission is to \"promote student achievement and preparation for global competitiveness by fostering educational excellence and ensuring equal access.\" Like most federal agencies, ED receives funds in support of its mission through various federal budget and appropriations processes. These processes are complex. For example, ED receives both mandatory and discretionary appropriations; ED is annually provided forward funds and advance appropriations for some\u2014but not all\u2014discretionary programs; ED awards both formula and competitive grants; and a portion of ED's budget subsidizes student loan costs (through both direct loans and loan guarantees). Because of this complexity, analyzing ED's budget requires an understanding of a broad range of federal budget and appropriations concepts. This report provides an introduction to these concepts as they are used specifically in the context of the congressional appropriations process for ED. It was designed for readers who are new or returning to the topic of ED budget and appropriations. The first section of this report provides an introduction to key terms and concepts in the federal budget and appropriations process with special relevance for ED.

    "crs_RL31572": "The committee structure established by Congress during the 20th century assigns a prominent role to the Appropriations Committees of the House and Senate for both the development of appropriations legislation and oversight over budget execution. The Appropriations Committees, in turn, have created a system of subcommittees designed to facilitate their ability to carry out these tasks. The number and jurisdictions of appropriations subcommittees have evolved to meet changing needs and circumstances. For example, reorganization was undertaken at the beginning of the 108th Congress in response to the creation of a new Department of Homeland Security. After the legislation establishing the new department was enacted, the House Appropriations Committee established a new subcommittee. This modification of subcommittee structure affected eight of the existing subcommittees and was one of the most extensive reorganizations of the Appropriations Committees since the 1920s. Shortly thereafter, a similar change was made in the Senate Appropriations Committee. Reorganization can also be undertaken to adapt to changes in congressional priorities. For example, in the reorganization that occurred at the start of the 109th Congress, both the House and the Senate undertook a major change in subcommittee structure. This resulted in the elimination of three appropriations subcommittees in the House and one in the Senate and ultimately affected the jurisdictions of 10 appropriations subcommittees in the House and 8 in the Senate. Another major reorganization at the beginning of the 110th Congress again shifted subcommittee jurisdiction to reestablish parallel House and Senate subcommittees.

Since its inception, CFIUS has operated at the nexus of shifting concepts of national security and major changes in technology, especially relative to various notions of national eco nomic security, and a changing global economic order that is marked in part by emerging economies such as China that are playing a more active role in the global economy. As a basic premise, the U.S. historical approach to international investment has aimed to establish an open and rules-based international economic system that is consistent across countries and in line with U.S. economic and national security interests. This policy also has fundamentally maintained that FDI has positive net benefits for the U.S. and global economy, except in certain cases in which national security concerns outweigh other considerations and for prudential reasons. Recently, some policymakers argued that certain foreign investment transactions, particularly by entities owned or controlled by a foreign government, investments with leading-edge or foundational technologies, or investments that may compromise personally identifiable information, are affecting U.S. national economic security. As a result, they supported greater CFIUS scrutiny of foreign investment transactions, including a mandatory approval process for some transactions. Some policymakers also argued that the CFIUS review process should have a more robust economic component, possibly even to the extent of an industrial policy-type approach that uses the CFIUS national security review process to protect and promote certain industrial sectors in the economy. Others argued, however, that the CFIUS review process should be expanded to include certain transactions that had not previously been reviewed, but that CFIUS' overall focus should remain fairly narrow.

    "crs_R45696": "This report summarizes and analyzes selected forest management provisions enacted in the 115th Congress and compares them with prior law or policy. These provisions were enacted through two legislative vehicles: The Stephen Sepp Wildfire Suppression Funding and Forest Management Activities Act, enacted as Division O of the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2018 (P.L. 115-141) and signed into law on March 23, 2018. The Agricultural Improvement Act of 2018 (P.L. 115-334, Title VIII), signed into law on December 20, 2018. This law is commonly referred to as the 2018 farm bill. Both laws included provisions that address forest management through three general perspectives: (1) management of forested federal land, (2) federal programs to support forest management on nonfederal lands, and (3) programs to promote or conduct forestry research (to benefit both federal and nonfederal forests). This report focuses primarily on the provisions related to management of forested federal land. The federal forest management provisions change how the Forest Service (FS, within the Department of Agriculture (USDA)) and the Bureau of Land Management (BLM, within the Department of the Interior (DOI)) manage their lands. FS is responsible for managing the 193 million acres of the National Forest System (NFS), and BLM manages 246 million acres of public lands under its jurisdiction. This report begins with background information on the NFS and BLM's public lands and an overview of two laws: the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), and the Healthy Forests Restoration Act (HFRA). These laws, among others, authorize specific forest management activities and establish procedures relevant to the respective agency's decisionmaking processes for those activities. The 115th Congress enacted provisions that affect how FS and BLM implement those activities and procedural requirements. The report summarizes and analyzes the provisions in the following categories: project planning and implementation, wildland fire management, forest management and restoration programs, and miscellaneous. Within each of those categories, the report broadly discusses relevant issues, summarizes the changes made in the 115th Congress, and discusses potential issues for Congress related to that category. Some provisions or sections are covered in more depth than others, generally reflecting the complexity of the issue, nature of the enacted changes, or level of congressional interest.

    "crs_R41364": "The Bush tax cuts, enacted in 2001 and 2003, were scheduled to expire at the end of 2010. Among the expiring tax provisions was a lower 15% rate for long-term capital gains and dividends, with a 0% tax rate on capital gains and dividends for taxpayers subject to ordinary rates of 15% or less. Absent legislative action, capital gains tax rates would have reverted to pre-2003 rates of 20% and 10% (18% and 8% for assets held for five years or more), and dividends would be taxed at ordinary rates. The highest ordinary tax rate is currently 35% but, absent change, will rise to 39.6%. President Obama proposed in both his budget outlines (FY2010 and FY2011) to retain the 15% and 0% rates for lower- and middle-income taxpayers, but to tax both dividends and capital gains at 20% for married couples with income of $250,000 or more and single taxpayers with income of $200,000 or more. The tax rates were temporarily extended through the end of 2012 by the Tax Relief, Unemployment Insurance Reauthorization, and Job Creation Act of 2010 (P.L. 111-312). The final resolution at the beginning of 2013 (American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012, P.L. 112-240) was to tax capital gains for higher-income individuals at the higher rate, but at incomes of $480,050 for married couples and $453,350 for singles in 2018, considerably higher than those proposed by President Obama. Compared with most other tax provisions, the potential revenue gain scored for an increase in capital gains taxes is strongly affected by behavioral responses assumed by the Joint Committee on Taxation (JCT) and the Department of the Treasury. As an illustration, the Obama Administration estimated in February 2010 that allowing the Bush tax cuts for capital gains to expire would have raised $16 billion of revenue in FY2019. Yet, based on Congressional Budget Office (CBO) projections in January 2010, the current effective capital gains tax was 13.3% in 2008 and would have increased to 17.9% in 2019; applying the differential in these rates to the realizations in 2019 would have produced a revenue difference of $40 billion. Although some of this differential could arise from different forecasts, assumptions about behavioral responses are the main reason for the reduction in projected revenues. To address these potential behavioral responses, some supporters of increasing taxes on capital gains (given that such gains",
    "crs_R40482": "The annual Department of State, Foreign Operations, and Related Programs appropriations legislation (SFOPS) funds many of the nondefense international affairs activities of the government. It is one of 12 appropriations bills that Congress considers annually to fund the discretionary activities of the government. Congress structures SFOPS into several titles, which consist of broad spending categories. These titles are subdivided into paragraphs that each address one component account, a funding line item that includes one or several activities of the government. A single component account may cover one agency's entire annual budget, grant funds to an independent organization, or fund multiple activities associated with statutory authorities, among other things. In the FY2019 Consolidated Appropriations Act (P.L. 116-6), the Department of State, Foreign Operations, and Related Programs Appropriations Act (Division F) is divided into eight titles, each associated with the following activities: Many of the component accounts within these titles correspond to one or several authorities in statute. Major acts in Title 22 include the State Department Basic Authorities Act of 1956 (P.L. 84-885; hereinafter the Basic Authorities Act), the Foreign Service Act of 1980 (P.L. 96-465), and the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 (P.L. 87-195; hereinafter the FAA), among others.

    "crs_RL33243": "The Small Business Administration (SBA) is authorized to provide assistance to small businesses in a variety of ways. The SBA's mission is to promote the interests of small businesses to enhance competition in the private marketplace. The SBA's programs are designed to enhance small business access to capital, contracting, and technical assistance. The SBA's disaster loans are unique in two respects: they are the only loans made by the SBA that (1) go directly to the ultimate borrower and (2) are not limited to small businesses. The SBA's disaster loans are available to individuals, businesses, and nonprofit organizations in declared disaster areas. About 80% of the SBA's direct disaster loans are issued to individuals and households (renters and property owners) to repair and replace homes and personal property. In recent years, the SBA Disaster Loan Program has been the subject of regular congressional and media attention because of concerns expressed about the time it takes the SBA to process disaster loan applications. The SBA disbursed $401 million in disaster loans in FY2016, $889 million in FY2017, and $3.59 billion in FY2018. The SBA's entrepreneurial development (ED) noncredit programs provide a variety of management and training services to small businesses. Initially, the SBA provided its own management and technical assistance training programs. Over time, the SBA has come to rely increasingly on third parties to provide that training. The SBA receives appropriations for seven ED programs and two ED initiatives: Small Business Development Centers (SBDCs); the Microloan Technical Assistance Program; Women Business Centers (WBCs); SCORE; the Program for Investment in Microentrepreneurs (PRIME); Veterans Programs (including Veterans Business Outreach Centers, Boots to Business, Veteran Women Igniting the Spirit of Entrepreneurship [VWISE], Entrepreneurship Bootcamp for Veterans with Disabilities, and Boots to Business: Reboot); the Native American Outreach Program (NAO); the Entrepreneurial Development Initiative (Regional Innovation Clusters); and the Entrepreneurship Education Initiative. The SBA's ED programs are designed to encourage competition within each industry, encourage competition within each industry, and provide technical assistance to small businesses.

    "crs_R44857": "The Constitution gives no direct role to Congress in conducting federal law enforcement. While Congress enjoys the legislative power under Article I of the Constitution, which includes substantial authority to investigate the executive branch pursuant to its oversight function, criminal investigations and prosecutions are generally considered core executive functions entrusted with the executive branch un der Article II. Because of the potential conflicts of interest that may arise when the executive branch investigates itself, however, there have often been calls for prosecutors with independence from the executive branch. In response, Congress and the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) have used both statutory and regulatory mechanisms to establish a process for such inquiries. These responses have attempted, in different ways, to balance the competing goals of independence and accountability with respect to inquiries of executive branch officials. This report first analyzes the use of special prosecutors and independent counsels that were authorized under now-expired provisions of the Ethics in Government Act of 1978, as well as the use of special counsels that are currently authorized by DOJ regulations. A glossary of terms at the beginning of the report briefly defines these italicized terms. The report continues with an examination of various legal questions relevant to these efforts. As a threshold matter, some have challenged the appointment of a special counsel under the current regulations as unconstitutional under the Appointments Clause. More broadly, designing a statutory framework for criminal investigations and prosecutions with independence from the executive branch raises questions about how this can be achieved consistent with the requirements of the Constitution. For instance, the Supreme Court upheld the constitutionality of the since-expired independent counsel statute in the 1988 case of Morrison v. Olson, but has not applied the reasoning of Morrison in subsequent cases raising related issues. The constitutional status of a statutory framework analogous to the independent counsel statute is thus subject to debate. Several bills introduced in the 116th Congress (including S. 71 and H.R. 197, which merge aspects of two preceding bills introduced in the 115th Congress, S. 1735 and S. 1741) statutorily insulate a special counsel from removal, echoing aspects of the independent counsel statute's provisions. Whether such proposals would withstand constitutional challenge today might ultimately turn on the continued vitality of the analysis applied in Morrison.",
    "crs_R45484": "The Disaster Relief Fund (DRF) is one of the most-tracked single accounts funded by Congress each year. Managed by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), it is the primary source of funding for the federal government's domestic general disaster relief programs. These programs, authorized under the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act, as amended (42 U.S.C. 5121 et seq.), outline the federal role in supporting state, local, tribal, and territorial governments as they respond to and recover from a variety of incidents. They take effect in the event that nonfederal levels of government find their own capacity to deal with an incident is overwhelmed. The current emergency management policy environment assumes this federal role in domestic disaster relief as the default position and the availability of resources through the DRF a necessary requirement. However, this was not always the case. The concept of general disaster relief from the federal government predates both FEMA and the Stafford Act, but federal involvement in relief after natural and man-made disasters was very rare before the Civil War, and was at times considered unconstitutional. Domestic disaster relief efforts became more common after the Civil War, but were not seen as a necessary obligation of the federal government. Standing federal domestic disaster relief programs and a pool of resources to fund them only emerged after the Second World War. Prior to the development of these programs, domestic disaster relief and recovery was a matter for private nongovernmental organizations and state and local governments. Once established, the federal role in disaster response and recovery grew, proving politically popular and resilient despite periodic concerns about management, execution, and budgetary impacts. As the DRF is the source of funding for most general disaster relief programs, it is an indicator of the scope of those programs and the volume of taxpayer-funded aid they provide. Understanding the trends in the growth of the federal government's role in general disaster relief and recovery, and the associated costs of that role, may be useful as Congress considers changes in both emergency management and budgetary policies. This report introduces the DRF and outlines how its resources are made available through a series of simple questions, presents a brief history of the federal government's involvement in domestic disaster relief, describes how the request for general disaster relief funding has been formulated over time, and examines the congressional response to those requests. It also provides the funding history for the DRF, and",
    "crs_R45122": "The United States and Afghan governments, along with partner countries, remain engaged in combat with a robust Taliban-led insurgency. The conflict also involves an array of other armed groups, including active affiliates of both Al Qaeda (AQ) and the Islamic State (IS, also known as ISIS, ISIL, or by the Arabic acronym Da'esh). Since early 2015, the NATO-led mission in Afghanistan, known as \"Resolute Support Mission\" (RSM), has focused on training, advising, and assisting Afghan government forces; combat operations by U.S. counterterrorism forces, along with some partner forces, also continue. These two \"complementary missions\" make up Operation Freedom's Sentinel (OFS). Simultaneously, the United States is engaged in an aggressive diplomatic effort to end the war, most notably through direct talks with Taliban representatives (a dramatic reversal of U.S. policy). A draft framework, in which the Taliban would prohibit terrorist groups from operating on Afghan soil in return for the eventual withdrawal of U.S. forces, was reached between U.S. and Taliban negotiators in January 2019, though lead U.S. negotiator Zalmay Khalilzad insists that \"nothing is agreed until everything is agreed.\" Negotiations do not, as of May 2019, directly involve representatives of the Afghan government, leading some to worry that the United States will prioritize a military withdrawal over a complex political settlement that preserves some of the social, political, and humanitarian gains made since 2001. Underlying the negotiations is the unsettled state of Afghan politics, which is a major complicating factor: Afghanistan held inconclusive parliamentary elections in October 2018 and the all-important presidential election, originally scheduled for April 2019, has now been postponed twice until September 2019. The Afghan government has made some progress in reducing corruption and implementing its budgetary commitments, but faces domestic criticism for its failure to guarantee security and prevent insurgent gains. The United States has contributed approximately $133 billion in various forms of aid to Afghanistan over the past decade and a half, from building up and sustaining the Afghan National Defense and Security Forces (ANDSF) to economic development. This assistance has increased Afghan government capacity, but prospects for stability in Afghanistan appear distant. Some U.S. policymakers still",
    "gao_GAO-18-547": "Why GAO Did This Study In 2012, Education began offering a voluntary process to certify borrowers' public service employment and loans as eligible for PSLF. In September 2017, 10 years after the program was established, Education began accepting loan forgiveness applications from borrowers. GAO was asked to review Education's PSLF program. This report examines (1) the extent to which borrowers have taken an initial step towards qualifying for PSLF by having their employment and loans certified as eligible for PSLF, and (2) the extent to which Education has provided borrowers with sufficient information to help them determine which employers qualify for PSLF. GAO reviewed relevant laws, regulations, and guidance; analyzed Education data on PSLF borrowers' qualifying payments; and interviewed Education officials and loan servicers. What GAO Found Over 890,000 borrowers have taken an initial step towards qualifying for the Public Service Loan forgiveness (PSLF) program by voluntarily having their employment and loans certified as eligible for PSLF, according to data from the Department of Education's (Education) Public Service Loan Fund (PSLF) servicer as of April 2018. Of these, over 520,000 borrowers had recorded at least one qualifying payment that counted towards the 120 required to be eligible for loan forgiveness. Of these, over 280,000 borrowers were denied, primarily due to missing information on the form or because they did not have qualifying federal loans or work for a qualifying employer. Education has conducted some outreach to communicate PSLF program requirements to borrowers, but the large number of borrowers whose certification requests and forgiveness applications were denied suggests that many borrowers do not understand or are not aware of these requirements. For example, over half of borrowers that requested to have their employment and loans certified as eligible for PSLF had not made any qualifying payments at the time of certification because they were not on qualifying repayment plans, had loans in a deferment or forbearance, were still in the grace period before starting repayment, or had recently consolidated their loans, among other reasons. Education could provide more comprehensive information to improve program administration and determine whether borrowers' employment qualifies for PSLF. Education's guidance and instructions to the PSLF loan servicer are dispersed across multiple documents, including Education's original contract with the servicer, multiple updates to the contract, and hundreds of emails. According to PSLF servicer officials, administering the program based on this fragmented",
    "gao_GAO-19-193": "Why GAO Did This Study IRS has incurred tens of millions of dollars in costs with little or no revenue collected for most of the PDC cases that IRS has closed. The Fixing America's Surface Transportation (FAST) Act mandated that IRS assign inactive tax debt cases to private collection agencies. GAO was asked to review IRS's PDC program. This report assesses the extent to which IRS (1) documented PDC program objectives and measures; (2) documented data on PDC revenue collection and cost results, and used these data to improve the program and meet its objectives; and (3) addressed PDC program risks to prevent or address scams or other harmful effects on taxpayers. GAO reviewed IRS documents and data, and interviewed IRS officials and external stakeholders. What GAO Found The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) has not clearly defined program objectives, measures, and targets for the Private Debt Collection (PDC) program. IRS officials explained that they wanted some experience with the program before establishing its objectives and measures, so in June 2018 and August 2018, IRS held working sessions to draft the program's mission, vision, and values statements, and link performance metrics to them. However, GAO found that these measures did not clearly link to two of the three PDC objectives\u2014applying tax laws consistently with IRS collection practices and providing taxpayers an opportunity to understand and resolve their tax obligations. IRS officials said they need more time to finalize the program objectives and measures and develop related targets. IRS's reporting on the PDC program to Congress did not provide complete, quality financial information on some of the program's results for revenue collected and costs. For example, IRS's reporting did not clarify how much of the collected revenue went to the general fund of the Treasury (the Treasury) rather than to IRS for two special funds. IRS officials said they plan for future reports to include a program balance table and retained fund balance tables. However, they said they do not plan to include this in the report because IRS is not required to include this in the report. IRS has not conducted any analysis of PDC results to determine which types of cases are not potentially collectible and should not be assigned to collection agencies because they result in little or no collected revenue. IRS officials said they are not conducting or planning such analyses because their priority is to fully implement the program and assign the types of cases that the FAST Act mandates. IRS has established a risk management process for the P",

In 2012, OMB issued a memorandum that required agencies to move aggressively to dispose of excess properties held by the federal government and more efficiently use real estate assets. In 2013, OMB clarified its policy to dispose of excess properties and promote more efficient use of real property assets. GAO was asked to review the federal government's real property management. This report examines (1) the approaches and any challenges the 24 Chief Financial Officers (CFO) Act agencies identified to achieving their Reduce the Footprint (RTF) reduction targets for all their domestic office and warehouse space; (2) the extent to which these agencies reduced space and met their fiscal year 2016 RTF targets; and (3) how the General Services Administration (GSA) manages vacated space that it has leased to these agencies. GAO reviewed the 24 CFO Act agencies' fiscal year 2016 and 2017 RTF Plans and interviewed officials from GSA and OMB. GAO also reviewed relevant literature and interviewed officials from five case study agencies selected based on their experiences reducing space and their experiences in meeting their RTF targets. What GAO Found The 24 CFO Act agencies identified similar strategies to more efficiently use space and common challenges they encountered in achieving their RTF targets. The agencies' Plans cited consolidation, co-location, and disposal as the primary means to reduce their office and warehouse space, activities mentioned in the National Strategy. Agencies also cited other methods, such as utilizing telework and decreasing the space they allocate per person to achieve space reductions. The 24 CFO Act agencies also described the major challenges they anticipated facing in their efforts to meet their RTF targets. The agencies most frequently cited the following challenges: Space reduction costs: Twenty of the 24 agencies stated that the costs of space reduction projects pose a challenge. For example, the Department of Labor reported in its fiscal year 2017 Plan that it did not have sufficient funding to implement a space reduction project that would have reduced commercially leased office space by 4,000 square feet. Mission delivery: Thirteen of the 24 agencies reported that mission delivery requirements can also affect their ability to reduce space. For example, the Social Security Administration (SSA) stated that its efforts to reduce space are affected by its mission, which requires offices widely dispersed throughout the country to",

State provides these allowances in four broad categories: (1) cost-of-living allowances, (2) recruitment and retention incentives, (3) quarters allowances, and (4) other allowances. GAO was asked to review State's allowances for employees serving overseas. This report (1) describes the allowances State offers its employees serving overseas and (2) examines the amount State spent annually on these allowances from fiscal years 2011 through 2016. GAO analyzed State's data on allowances for fiscal years 2011 through 2016, reviewed State documents, and interviewed State officials. What GAO Found State provides 14 allowances to employees serving overseas to compensate them for the costs and hardships related to foreign assignments across four broad categories\u2014cost-of-living, recruitment and retention incentives, quarters, and other allowances. Cost-of-living allowances reimburse employees for certain excess costs, exclusive of any quarters costs, incurred from employment overseas. The post allowance is granted to employees officially stationed at posts or foreign areas where the cost of living, exclusive of the cost of quarters, is substantially higher than in Washington, D.C. It is designed to permit employees to spend the same portion of their salaries for standard living expenses as they would if they were living in Washington, D.C. The foreign transfer allowance defrays an employee's extraordinary, necessary, and reasonable costs when he transfers to a post in a foreign area. The separate maintenance allowance (SMA) defrays the additional expense of maintaining family members at another location (1) because of dangerous, notably unhealthful, or excessively adverse living conditions at the overseas post of assignment, (2) for the convenience of the U.S. government, or (3) because of special needs or hardships involving the employee or a family member. State spent $2.9 billion on 14 allowances from fiscal years 2011 through 2016, 70 percent of which went to the three most expensive allowances\u2014the education allowance, hardship pay, and post allowance. The education allowance accounted for 30 percent of the total ($853.0 million), hardship pay accounted for 25 percent ($732.3 million), and the post allowance accounted for 15 percent ($417.3 million).

The MMI Fund is statutorily required to maintain at least a 2 percent capital ratio. The National Housing Act requires GAO to review the MMI Fund annually. This report examines (1) the types of information actuarial reviews and other assessments provide about the MMI Fund's financial condition, including its ability to remain self-sufficient; (2) the extent to which the capital requirement and stress testing practices for the MMI Fund are consistent with principles and practices underlying those of other financial institutions; and (3) key advantages and disadvantages of including both forward and Home Equity Conversion Mortgages (HECM) in the MMI Fund's capital assessment. GAO reviewed actuarial reports and related FHA reports to Congress, and interviewed FHA officials and industry stakeholders. What GAO Found The Federal Housing Administration's (FHA) annual budgetary and actuarial reviews of the Mutual Mortgage Insurance Fund (MMI Fund) serve different purposes, stem from different requirements, and are conducted by different entities. The actuarial reviews estimate the economic value of the forward mortgage and HECM portfolios separately, and FHA combines these estimates to calculate the capital ratio (that is, the economic value divided by the insurance-in-force). The independent actuarial reviews also have projected the MMI Fund's performance under alternative economic scenarios, including stress scenarios. The MMI Fund's capital requirement is consistent with GAO's framework element of transparency and partially consistent with two other elements\u2014that the requirement include both risk-based and fixed components and that the requirement be designed to cover unexpected losses and be based on specified risk thresholds. However, the MMI Fund's capital requirement is not consistent with the framework element on including accountability mechanisms. GAO was unable to determine whether the requirement is consistent with the element on balancing financial soundness with the entity's role and mission because such an assessment would require more information about the severity of the economic conditions the capital requirement was designed to withstand without supplemental funding. The stress tests of the MMI Fund are consistent with two of the five elements in GAO's framework\u2014that stress testing methods and results be transparent and stress testing scenarios capture relevant risks.

This report examines (1) what contracting officers consider when assigning NAICS codes to federal contracts and the status of efforts to clarify code assignment and (2) stakeholder views on NAICS code assignment and the number and outcomes of appeals filed with SBA. GAO reviewed federal laws and regulations related to NAICS code assignment and relevant policies and procedures from the four agencies with the highest indefinite delivery/indefinite quantity (ID/IQ) contract obligations from fiscal years 2011\u20132015 (the 5 most recent years of Federal Procurement Data System-Next Generation data available when GAO began its review). GAO selected four contracts based on (1) whether they had small business set-asides, (2) the NAICS code, and (3) the number of orders. GAO reviewed contract documentation, such as acquisition plans and market research documents, for one ID/IQ contract from each of the four agencies. GAO also interviewed contracting officers, small business specialists, and SBA procurement center representatives (PCR) associated with each contract. GAO also reviewed SBA's 2013 rule on assigning NAICS codes to multiple-award contracts. What GAO Found Contracting officers at the Army, Navy, Department of Homeland Security (DHS), and Health and Human Services (HHS) stated that contracting officers refer to the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) when assigning NAICS codes and consider a variety of factors, including a contract's scope of work. Contracting officers at these four agencies cited several factors, including a contract's scope of work, that are involved in determining the NAICS code for a contract solicitation or an order: statements of work and market research reports. The contracting officers GAO interviewed at all four agencies stated that they review the statements of work and assign the code that represents the majority of the work. All four agencies' contracting officers also consulted with their small business specialists when assigning NAICS codes.

The Secretary of Defense established a cross-functional team to manage the transfer of background investigations for DOD personnel security clearances from the Office of Personnel Management to DOD. This team is required to report directly to the Secretary. In addition, the Deputy Secretary of Defense established 9 additional cross-functional teams to implement reform initiatives for improving DOD's business operations. These teams report to the Chief Management Officer (CMO). As of May 2018, the teams ranged from 5 to 12 members, and OCMO officials stated that the size of the teams can vary based on the knowledge and expertise the team needs to implement its initiatives. DOD has not issued an organizational strategy that outlines steps for advancing a collaborative culture within the department. OCMO officials told GAO that they have not completed the strategy because they want to align it with the National Defense Strategy and the National Defense Business Operations Plan, which were issued in May 2018. GAO recommended, and DOD concurred",
    "gao_GAO-18-381": "Why GAO Did This Study The Paperwork Reduction Act (PRA) requires federal agencies to estimate the burden they impose on the public. The act also requires GAO to report on the extent to which agencies consult with the public on the estimates. GAO was asked to review the PRA. This report examines (1) how agencies estimate both the burden hours and costs of their information collections, and any limitations of their approaches, and (2) the extent to which agencies consult with and receive comments from the public on the collections' estimated burden. GAO reviewed PRA and OMB regulations and guidance, and interviewed agency officials. GAO also reviewed the Federal Register notices and supporting statements for the 50 largest information collections that were selected based on total annual burden hours and cost estimates. GAO also reviewed the PRA and OMB guidance and interviewed agency officials. What GAO Found The four agencies GAO reviewed used data and professional judgment to estimate the burden hours associated with their information collections, but limitations included inconsistent cost estimates and insufficient review. The PRA requires that agencies develop an objectively supported burden hour estimate, but neither the act, nor Office of Management and Budget (OMB) regulations, prescribe how agencies should develop these estimates. Among the four agencies, IRS was the only one to report gathering original data on public burden through surveys of individual taxpayers and businesses to help inform the estimates for its two largest information collections. The PRA also requires that agencies include respondent time costs in their supporting statements, but the four agencies did not always include this information in the supporting statements. For example, the Department of Transportation (DOT) did not include respondent time costs in its two largest information collections because, based on their professional judgment, the information collection activities are incidental to routine business operations and therefore should not be included in respondent time cost estimates. Unless OMB takes action to ensure that agencies consistently follow its guidelines to include respondent time costs, agencies will likely continue to not meet the requirement and omit this information. Without clear guidance about how to consistently estimate respondent time costs, Congress and the administration cannot effectively compare information collection cost savings for the public. The four agencies GAO reviewed did not detect errors in burden and cost estimates or other discrepancies in their independent review processes. For example, GAO found multiple calculation errors in the supporting statements at three of the four agencies\u2014USDA, HHS, and DOT\u2014that over- or underestimated burden hours and costs",
    "gao_GAO-18-50": "Why GAO Did This Study In fiscal year 2016, Border Patrol apprehended almost 2 million individuals and seized over 75,000 pounds of drugs at checkpoints. GAO has previously reported that Border Patrol's approach to limiting illegal cross-border activity can adversely affect communities near checkpoints. GAO was asked to review Border Patrol's efforts to limit illegal cross-border activity. This report examines (1) how Border Patrol deploys agents and how agents are scheduled for operations and patrol activities, (2) how checkpoints contribute to apprehensions and seizures, and (3) how Border Patrol responds to community concerns. GAO analyzed Border Patrol data on agent deployment, apprehensions, and seizures from fiscal years 2013 through 2016, and interviewed officials from Border Patrol headquarters and nine southwest border sectors, selected based on geographic location and other factors. What GAO Found The U.S. Customs and Border Protection's (CBP) Border Patrol deploys agents based on factors such as the availability of agents for a given shift, the geography in a station's area of responsibility, and illegal traffic patterns. Border Patrol officials said that decisions about agent deployment in terms of location and activity are based on multiple factors, including the availability of agents for a given shift, the geography in a station's area of responsibility, and illegal traffic patterns. For example, when considering the various assignments that need to be filled for a given day, supervisors must take into account agents that are unavailable because they are off duty, on scheduled leave, or are scheduled to attend training. The geography in a station's area of responsibility can also affect decisions about where to deploy available agents. For example, Border Patrol may have limited access to certain areas because of challenging terrain, limited or poor quality roads, or private ownership. Station officials also consider checkpoint operations in their deployment decisions. From fiscal years 2012 through 2016, 33 percent of southwest border apprehensions were made one-half mile or less from the border, and over this time period apprehensions increasingly occurred closer to the border. Specifically, from fiscal years 2012 through 2016, apprehensions one-half mile or less from the border increased from 24 percent to 42 percent. During the same time period, the percentage of apprehensions occurring more than 20 miles from the border steadily dropped, from 27 percent in fiscal year 2012 to 15",
    "gao_GAO-18-618": "Why GAO Did This Study U.S. agencies have provided assistance to police in El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras, three countries with notable histories of human rights violations by security forces. The National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2018 included a provision for GAO to report on various aspects of U.S. police training efforts in El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras. This report examines, for the Northern Triangle, (1) the extent to which U.S. agencies have established objectives for and delivered training to professionalize police, including promoting respect for human rights; (2) the extent to which agencies have collected data related to police training indicators; and (3) actions U.S. agencies have planned and undertaken to support the ability of partner nations to sustain police training. GAO reviewed government-wide and agency strategies, guidance documents, and project documents, and interviewed officials in Washington, D.C., and El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras. What GAO Found U.S. agencies have established few objectives to provide police training to police in El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras, but have not consistently incorporated respect for human rights in training delivered to police. For example, while U.S. national security strategies for El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras all include objectives to professionalize police, government-wide strategies and police assistance project documents include few objectives specifically to provide police training. Further, police assistance project documents also vary in the extent to which they include objectives or other internal control mechanisms to ensure human rights content is incorporated in police training. For example, while the Department of Defense (DOD) has not established specific objectives to train police on human rights, DOD officials told GAO that training delivered to police in El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras during fiscal years 2014 through 2017 included content on respect for human rights. Further, State has not established specific objectives or other internal control mechanisms to ensure that police training incorporates content promoting respect for human rights. For example, State officials told GAO that some INL-funded police training includes such content. Without such objectives or internal control mechanisms, it may be difficult for these agencies to account for the extent to which implementing partners include human rights content or to assess progress being made with respect to partner nation police forces' respect for human rights\u2014a key goal of U.S. strategy in Central America. DOD and USAID have collected some information on the number",
    "gao_GAO-18-272": "Why GAO Did This Study In 2015, there were 902 foodborne disease outbreaks reported in the United States that resulted in 15,202 illnesses, 950 hospitalizations, 15 deaths, and 20 food product recalls. GAO was asked to review food safety. This report examines (1) USDA's efforts to reduce the level of pathogens in poultry products and (2) challenges USDA is addressing in reducing the level of pathogens in meat and poultry products. GAO reviewed USDA documents and interviewed agency officials and stakeholders from industry, consumer advocacy, and public health organizations. What GAO Found The U.S. Department of Agriculture's (USDA) Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) has developed or revised pathogen standards for assessing the effectiveness of plants' controls in reducing the level of pathogens in certain meat and poultry products. More specifically, FSIS has developed pathogen standards for some beef, pork, chicken, and turkey products but not for other products that are widely available, and its basis for deciding which products to consider for new pathogen standards is unclear. In addition, as of 2011, FSIS has revised pathogen standards for chicken and turkey products, but standards for other products are outdated, with no time frames for revision. In addition, as of 2011, FSIS has revised pathogen standards for chicken and turkey products, but standards for other products are outdated, with no time frames for revision. In the absence of new standards, FSIS has other tools to ensure plants are controlling pathogens. For example, the agency continues to test beef for levels of Escherichia coli, and FSIS inspectors at plants routinely check records to verify a plant's compliance with its Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Point plans. In the absence of new standards, FSIS has other tools to ensure plants are controlling pathogens. For example, the agency continues to test beef for levels of E. coli, and FSIS inspectors at plants are to routinely check records to verify a plant's compliance with its Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Point plans.

    "gao_GAO-18-45": "Why GAO Did This Study Solid rocket motors (SRM) are the propulsion systems that propel various types of missiles and are also used in space launch activities, including the National Aeronautics and Space Administration's (NASA) Space Shuttle program. DOD relies on a multi-tiered supply chain to provide the SRMs that are used for missile propulsion. DOD reports that the SRM supplier base, including the sub-tier suppliers, is nearly identical across missile defense, tactical, and strategic missile systems that use SRMs. GAO was asked to review DOD's SRM supply chain. This report examines (1) trends in the SRM supply chain and the impact of these trends on the U.S. SRM supplier base, (2) the impact of these trends on the U.S. SRM supplier base, and (3) the extent to which manufacturing engineers' SRM design skills have declined since the missile program's inception. GAO reviewed DOD reports and DOD reports and interviewed DOD and industry officials. What GAO Found Over the last 20 years, the SRM industrial base has consolidated from six to two U.S. manufacturers\u2014Aerojet Rocketdyne and Orbital ATK. Both manufacturers produce the small and large SRMs used in tactical and missile defense systems, and Orbital ATK also produces SRMs for strategic missiles. A senior DOD industrial base official told GAO that current DOD needs require two SRM manufacturers, but there is not enough demand to keep three companies economically viable. In DOD's industrial base reports to Congress, MIBP has reported that, while other industrial sectors are supported by commercial markets in addition to government needs, SRM manufacturers cater largely to the defense and space missions of the government and generally do not have a commercial base that can sustain production when the federal government's demand fluctuates. As a result, similar to the impact of NASA's retirement on the SRM supplier base, trends or decisions made in a particular program area can have broader effects and potentially result in cost increases for other programs. For example, a company that is supporting space launch has decided to source its SRMs from Orbital ATK instead of Aerojet Rocketdyne, which had previously produced the motors. This arrangement will take effect in 2019, and Aerojet Rocketdyne officials said that",
    "gao_GAO-18-453": "Why GAO Did This Study Puget Sound is a large, complex, and potentially costly undertaking that involves many federal, state, local, tribal, and nongovernmental partners. GAO was asked to review Puget Sound restoration efforts. This report examines (1) Puget Sound restoration efforts and related expenditures for fiscal years 2012 through 2016; (2) how federal and nonfederal entities coordinate their restoration efforts and their views on this coordination; (3) the framework for assessing progress toward Puget Sound restoration; and (4) key factors, if any, federal and nonfederal entities identified that may limit the success of Puget Sound restoration. GAO surveyed 15 federal and 11 state entities and interviewed federal and nonfederal officials and representatives from conservation, agricultural, and fishing industry organizations. GAO also held six discussion groups with tribal and local representatives to obtain their views on factors that have helped and hindered their ability to implement restoration projects. What GAO Found Federal and state entities GAO surveyed identified numerous federal and state efforts that, in whole or in part, supported Puget Sound restoration from fiscal years 2012 through 2016. Some of these efforts focused exclusively on restoration activities in the Puget Sound basin, while others had a broader national, regional, or statewide focus or had a broader scope of work that did not center directly on restoration activities. These efforts were supported by a variety of federal and nonfederal funding sources, such as the Environmental Protection Agency's National Estuary Program and Puget Sound Geographic Program, which together expended about $142 million for activities in Puget Sound during this time frame according to EPA data. However, total expenditures across all restoration efforts are unknown, in part because of data limitations such as difficulties isolating expenditures specific to the Puget Sound basin for some efforts. Federal and nonfederal entities have established two primary interagency groups to coordinate Puget Sound restoration efforts at the strategic level and have identified both benefits and challenges to interagency coordination. The Puget Sound Management Conference, which started in 2007, and the Puget Sound Federal Task Force, which started in 2016, coordinate restoration efforts at the strategic level. The management conference focuses on issues surrounding Puget Sound restoration and tribal treaty rights. The federal task force coordinates the efforts of federal agencies in support of the CCMP and helps these agencies work together to fulfill federal trust responsibilities to the tribes as they relate to the CCMP.

    "gao_GAO-18-669": "Why GAO Did This Study The United States provides humanitarian assistance in countries that are often plagued by conflict, instability, or other issues that increase the risk of financial crimes. Some of these countries also face U.S. sanctions that are aimed at their governments or other actors that engage in terrorism or illicit activities. GAO was asked to review U.S. efforts to address banking access challenges encountered by nonprofit organizations (NPO). This report examines (1) the extent to which implementing partners of State and USAID experience banking access challenges that affect their implementation of humanitarian assistance projects, (2) USAID implementing partners' reporting on banking access challenges, and (3) actions relevant U.S. agencies have taken to help address banking access challenges encountered by NPOs. GAO reviewed relevant studies and USAID reports, and interviewed officials from Treasury, State, and USAID. What GAO Found For 7 of 18 selected U.S.-funded projects, the Department of State (State) and the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) had experienced banking access challenges that affected their implementation of humanitarian assistance projects. Most of the 18 partners GAO interviewed told GAO that they were able to mitigate these challenges through various actions or the challenges were not significant enough to affect project implementation. Nevertheless, a few partners noted that projects they were implementing were adversely affected by such challenges. For example, 1 of the 18 projects faced repeated delays as a result of banking access challenges. Additionally, 2 partners noted that they had to reduce the scope of implementation or suspend projects in their global humanitarian assistance portfolio because of banking access challenges. Furthermore, several partners and other NPOs told GAO that such challenges posed potential risks to project implementation. Lastly, a recent study found that more than two-thirds of all U.S.-based NPOs that work internationally experienced banking access challenges, but that few NPOs canceled programs as a result of those challenges. USAID generally does not require most partners to report in writing any challenges that do not affect implementation. Six of the 7 projects that noted experiencing banking access challenges were USAID projects. None of those 6 USAID partners reported on the banking access challenges they had experienced to USAID in their regular project reporting. USAID requires partners to report adverse effects to their projects, but 1 partner that faced delays on its project as a result of banking access challenges did not identify these challenges as the reason for delays in",
    "gao_GAO-18-659": "Why GAO Did This Study IRS's Office of Appeals is the only IRS unit with authority to consider settlements of tax controversies. Appeals is a separate unit within IRS and its chief reports directly to the Commissioner of Internal Revenue. GAO was asked to review IRS's appeals function. This report examines (1) the extent to which IRS has a standard process to resolve taxpayer appeals and (2) the extent to which Appeals measures its customer service and measures its performance. GAO analyzed IRS data on appeal cases closed from fiscal years 2014 through 2017, reviewed IRS documents, and interviewed IRS officials and external stakeholders. What GAO Found The Internal Revenue Service's (IRS) Office of Appeals (Appeals) has a standard process to resolve taxpayer appeals of IRS enforcement actions and decisions. Appeals is the only IRS unit with authority to consider settlements of tax controversies and has the primary responsibility to resolve these disputes without litigation to the maximum extent possible. Appeals has not conducted a skills gap analysis to help ensure it retains the necessary tax expertise to review appeals cases across multiple workstreams. Appeals has taken steps to mitigate the risk of having a sufficient number of staff with expertise in all areas of tax law. However, Appeals faces ongoing challenges in achieving its goal and may be unable to mitigate the risk of maintaining staff expertise. IRS does not monitor timeliness of transfers of all incoming appeal requests and Appeals does not communicate total resolution times to taxpayers. For appeal cases closed in fiscal year 2017, approximately 4 percent of collection appeals cases and nearly one quarter of examination appeal requests took more than 120 days to be transferred from IRS to Appeals. Delays in transferring appeals affect prompt resolution for the taxpayer and IRS. Additional monitoring of collection transfer time requirements together with establishing transfer time guidelines and procedures for examination appeal review could improve appeal review timeliness and overall taxpayer experience. Appeals measures its customer service standard internally, but does not make performance results available to taxpayers. Appeals conducts outreach at tax practitioner conferences to share information about its policy and procedures, but does not have a mechanism to solicit public input on policy changes. Appeals has taken steps to address practitioner reactions to operational changes underway. Appeals has acted to address practitioner reactions to operational changes underway. Developing a mechanism to leverage public input on future policy and procedure proposals would better position Appeals to bolster customer service and effectively implement changes",
    "gao_GAO-19-200": "Why GAO Did This Study The federal government provides E&T services to help individuals obtain and maintain jobs. In 2011, GAO reported that E&T programs were fragmented and overlapping, and that federal agencies had taken actions to address fragmentation and overlap. GAO was asked to review federal E&T programs. This report examines (1) how participation in and obligations for federal E&T programs have changed since GAO's 2011 report, (2) the extent to which E&T programs continue to provide similar services to similar populations, and examples of potential effects, and (3) the extent to which agencies have taken actions to address previously identified fragmentation and overlap among the programs and lessons learned. GAO analyzed federal program data from fiscal years 2009 through 2017, reviewed relevant federal guidance and other program documents, and interviewed federal agency officials. What GAO Found The number of federally funded employment and training (E&T) programs has decreased since GAO's 2011 report, but the number decreased due in part to eliminations. For fiscal year 2017, GAO identified 43 programs, four fewer than GAO reported in 2011. The number decreased because more programs were eliminated or defunded (6) than added (2). For example, in 2014, the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act (WIOA) eliminated at least four of GAO's identified E&T programs. This included the Department of Labor's (DOL) Veterans' Workforce Investment Program, Education's Grants to States for Workplace and Community Transition Training for Incarcerated Individuals, and the Department of Education's Migrant and Seasonal Farmworkers Program. In addition, Congress did not appropriate funds for Education's Tech Prep Education State Grants in fiscal year 2011 and DOL's Community Based Job Training Grants programs in fiscal year 2010, according to agencies' budget documents. GAO also identified two additional E&T programs through interviews with agency officials and a related GAO report: 1) Department of Veterans Affairs' (VA) Compensated Work Therapy, and 2) Department of Defense's (DOD) Job Training, Employment Skills Training, Apprenticeships, and Internships. The 43 E&T programs GAO identified in fiscal year 2017 are fragmented across nine federal agencies, as programs were in 2011. The 43 programs generally overlap in that they provide similar services to similar populations, according to GAO's survey analysis. In response to GAO's survey, almost all",

The Secret Service, with help from the Coast Guard and DOD, plays a vital role in protecting the President during his travels. The Act also requires that GAO report on the costs incurred by these agencies for providing protection\u2014including providing protection at nongovernmental properties. This report examines (1) the costs incurred by the Secret Service and DOD for the President's four trips to Mar-a-Lago from February 3, 2017 to March 5, 2017, and (2) the extent to which the Secret Service and DOD reported costs as required under the Presidential Protection Assistance Act of 1976. GAO reviewed relevant laws, regulations, and guidance; analyzed costs for the President's four trips to Mar-a-Lago from February 3, 2017 to March 5, 2017; and interviewed agency officials. What GAO Found For the President's four trips to Mar-a-Lago from February 3, 2017 to March 5, 2017, GAO estimates that federal agencies incurred costs of about $13.6 million. These costs consisted of approximately $10.6 million for operating costs and $3.0 million for temporary duty costs. The Departments of Defense (DOD) and Homeland Security (DHS) incurred the majority of these costs\u2014about $8.5 million and $5.1 million, respectively. The majority of costs incurred by the Secret Service were temporary duty costs associated with travel to protect the President. The number of agents assigned to the protective detail for each trip varied based on the number of protectees present (including foreign dignitaries) and unrelated events at the same location. The Secret Service leveraged support from across the agency and field offices across the country to implement protective operations for the President's travel. Agents were assigned as part of the protective detail\u2014providing twenty-four hour protection for the President or other protectees; members of the advance team\u2014determining and implementing the security plan for the site; or on-site support throughout the duration of the visit. The Secret Service incurred costs of approximately $396,000, primarily for Secret Service agents' temporary duty costs, while protecting Donald Trump Jr., Eric Trump, and their spouses during three international trips taken during January and February 2017, as shown in the table below. The Secret Service did not do so consistently, and DOD did not report any protection costs during",

GAO was asked to review the extent to which CFO Act agencies have followed OMB guidance for reporting improper payment risk assessments in their agency financial reports (AFR) or performance and accountability reports (PAR) for fiscal years 2014 through 2016. This report examines the extent to which (1) the 24 CFO Act agencies followed OMB guidance for reporting improper payment risk assessments in their AFRs or PARs for fiscal years 2014 through 2016 and (2) selected CFO Act agencies have designed control activities to include all of their programs and activities in their improper payment risk assessments at least once during a 3-year period, as required by the Improper Payments Information Act of 2002 (IPIA), as amended by the Improper Payments Elimination and Recovery Act of 2010 and the Improper Payments Elimination and Recovery Improvement Act of 2012. GAO analyzed OMB guidance and OMB guidance, and interviewed agency officials. What GAO Found The 24 Chief Financial Officers Act of 1990 (CFO Act) agencies, excluding the Department of Defense (DOD), reported in their AFRs or PARs that they completed at least one improper payment risk assessment on at least one program or activity in one or more of those years. For the agencies that reported that they completed an improper payment risk assessment, GAO found that most generally adhered to the reporting directives that were applicable for fiscal years 2014 through 2016. For example, for fiscal year 2014, 21 of the 24 CFO Act agencies reported completing a risk assessment, and for those 21 agencies, GAO found that 19 agencies adhered to OMB guidance for reporting the basis for grouping programs and activities. For fiscal years 2015 and 2016, all 18 CFO Act agencies that reported completing a risk assessment adhered to OMB guidance for this directive. GAO found that six agencies did not adhere to OMB reporting directives either in fiscal year 2015, fiscal year 2016, or both. Specifically, the Office of Personnel Management did not adhere to the reporting directives in fiscal year 2015. However, OPM corrected the reporting issue in fiscal year 2016. Three agencies\u2014the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), and the Social Security Administration (SSA)\u2014did not adhere to the reporting directives in fiscal years 2015 and 2016.

    "gao_GAO-18-177": "Why GAO Did This Study The FAA is responsible for providing air navigation services, including air traffic control across most of the United States, and is leading the Next Generation Air Transportation System (NextGen) effort. In 2007, DOD issued a memorandum directing DOD to equip military aircraft with ADS-B technology by January 1, 2020. Senate Report 114-255 included a provision that GAO assess issues related to the defense implications of implementation of NextGen. This report assesses the extent to which (1) DOD and FAA have identified security and operations risks and approved solutions to address these risks to military aircraft equipped with ADS-B Out technology; and (2) DOD has implemented key tasks in the 2007 Deputy Secretary of Defense memorandum on implementing NextGen. GAO reviewed relevant laws, guidance, and other documents; analyzed documents and interviewed officials from FAA, DOD, the military services, and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA); and visited multiple public websites. What GAO Found Since 2008, DOD and FAA have identified a variety of operations and physical security risks that could adversely affect military security and missions. These risks arise from information broadcast by ADS-B itself, as well as from potential ADS-B vulnerabilities to electronic warfare- and cyber-attacks, and from the potential divestment of secondary-surveillance radars. DOD and FAA have identified some potential mitigations for these risks, but the departments have not approved any solutions. For example, DOD and FAA have focused on equipping military aircraft with ADS-B technology and have not focused on solving or mitigating security risks from ADS-B. The approach being taken by FAA and DOD will not address key security risks that have been identified, and delays in producing an interagency agreement have significantly reduced the time available to implement any agreed-upon solutions before January 1, 2020, when the full deployment of ADS-B Out is required. Federal internal control standards state that federal agencies should make risk-based decisions in a timely manner. In the case of equipping military aircraft with ADS-B technology and addressing any risks associated with it, DOD and FAA have shared responsibility. In 2008 DOD informed FAA that military aircraft would need special accommodations to the ADS-B Out rule due to national security concerns, such as sensitive missions and electronic warfare vulnerabilities",
    "gao_GAO-18-478": "Why GAO Did This Study U.S. government support for the U.S.-flag fleet has helped meet national defense needs, but recent increases in the cost differential between U.S.-flag vessels versus foreign-flag vessels and decreases in the volumes of government cargo have made it more challenging to ensure the financial viability of U.S.-flag vessels. GAO was asked to review the U.S.-flag fleet. This report examines (1) the extent to which U.S. government support for the U.S.-flag fleet has helped meet national defense needs and (2) the challenges the U.S.-flag fleet faces in meeting national defense needs. GAO reviewed relevant laws, regulations, and agency documents; analyzed DOD and MARAD data; and interviewed officials from DOD, MARAD, and other federal agencies, as well as 14 MSP vessel operators. What GAO Found U.S. government support for the internationally trading U.S.-flag fleet has helped meet national defense needs, but recent increases in the cost differential between U.S.-flag vessels versus foreign-flag vessels and decreases in the volumes of government cargo have made it more challenging to ensure the financial viability of U.S.-flag vessels. For example, the Department of Transportation's (DOT) Maritime Security Program (MSP) provides a fixed financial incentive for vessel operators to maintain vessels under the U.S. flag, but on its own is not sufficient to support the higher costs of operating U.S.-flag vessels. In contrast, cargo preference requirements specify that certain percentages of all U.S. government cargo, military and otherwise, must be carried on U.S.-flag vessels, to the extent the vessels are available at reasonable rates. In contrast, while cargo preference requirements are a means of providing government support to U.S.-flag vessels, these requirements have had a negative impact on some non-defense programs. For example, the requirement that food aid agencies send a certain percentage of food aid on U.S.-flag vessels has resulted in higher shipping costs for these agencies, and USAID and USDA officials stated that this has reduced the amount of funds the agencies can spend on their mission to reduce hunger.

    "gao_GAO-19-128": "Why GAO Did This Study DOD is responsible for defending the U.S. homeland and interests from cyber attack, including those that occur in cyberspace and has developed capabilities for cyber operations. DOD has a long history of relying on IT systems to carry out its mission. However, DOD has not prioritized cybersecurity in weapon systems acquisitions. GAO was asked to review DOD's weapon systems cybersecurity. This report examines (1) factors that contribute to the current state of DOD weapon systems cybersecurity, and (2) steps DOD is taking to develop more cyber resilient weapon systems. GAO reviewed DOD policies and guidance, analyzed test reports, and interviewed DOD officials. What GAO Found Multiple factors contribute to the current state of the Department of Defense's (DOD) weapon systems cybersecurity, including: the increasingly computerized and networked nature of DOD weapons, DOD's past failure to prioritize weapon systems cybersecurity, and DOD's nascent understanding of how best to develop more cyber secure weapon systems. Specifically, DOD weapon systems are increasingly software and information technology dependent and more networked than ever before. This has transformed weapon capabilities and is a fundamental enabler of the United States' modern military capabilities. Yet this change has come at a cost. More weapon components can now be attacked using cyber capabilities. Furthermore, networks can be used as a pathway to attack other systems. GAO and others have warned of these risks for decades. Nevertheless, until recently, DOD did not prioritize cybersecurity in weapon systems acquisitions. In part because DOD historically focused on the cybersecurity of its networks but not weapon systems themselves, DOD is in the early stage of trying to understand how to apply cybersecurity to weapon systems. Several DOD officials explained that it will take some time, and possibly some missteps, for the department to learn what works and does not work with respect to weapon systems cybersecurity. GAO found that from 2012 to 2017, DOD testers routinely found mission-critical cyber vulnerabilities in nearly all weapon systems that were under development. Using relatively simple tools and techniques, testers were able to take control of these systems and largely operate undetected. In some cases, system operators were unable to effectively respond to the hacks. Furthermore, DOD does not know the full extent of its weapon system vulnerabilities because, for a number of reasons, tests were limited in scope and sophistication.",

NNSA has not had a supplier of unobligated LEU since 2013, when the United States lost its capability to produce tritium for the nuclear weapons stockpile. NNSA is taking or plans to take four actions to extend its existing inventories of enriched uranium to address its near-term tritium needs and has generally identified the costs, schedules, and risks for these actions. GAO was asked to review NNSA's actions. This report assesses (1) the actions NNSA is taking to extend its existing inventories of enriched uranium to address near-term tritium needs and the costs, schedules, and risks of those actions; (2) the extent to which NNSA's plan to analyze options for supplying enriched uranium in the long term is consistent with DOE directives; and (3) NNSA's preliminary cost estimates for long-term uranium enrichment technology options and the extent to which they meet best practices for reliable estimates. GAO reviewed NNSA and Department of Energy (DOE) documents and interviewed agency officials and representatives from industry. What GAO Found The National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA) is taking or plans to take four actions to extend its existing inventories of unobligated enriched uranium to address its near-term tritium needs and has generally identified the costs, schedules, and risks for these actions. These actions would together extend the supply of unobligated LEU from 2027 until approximately 2038 to 2041, according to NNSA documents. NNSA's October 2015 plan identified four actions: (1) extending the supply of unobligated LEU through contract storage and (2) downblending highly enriched uranium (HEU) from the defense programs inventory. NNSA's October 2015 plan did not identify any specific risks for these actions. NNSA is compensating the downblending contractor by transferring title of the derived LEU to the United States Enrichment Corporation (USEC), which will be retained as unobligated LEU and eventually sold to TVA for tritium production.

VAPIHCS relies on NHG to provide inpatient and specialty care services for veterans from the Pacific Islands. GAO was asked to review VAPIHCS' referral process. This report examines (1) the extent to which VAPIHCS provided primary and mental health care within VHA's timeliness goals, (2) the extent to which VAPIHCS provided specialty care services to veterans outside of VA, and (3) the challenges veterans face accessing health care services on the Pacific Islands. GAO reviewed VHA policy, procedures, and data; reviewed 30 medical records for veterans who accessed primary and mental health care services at one of the three clinics on the Pacific Islands of American Samoa, Guam, and the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands; and interviewed VAPIHCS and NHG officials. What GAO Found GAO's review of 30 medical records for veterans who accessed primary and mental health care services at one of the three clinics on the Pacific Islands of American Samoa, Guam, and the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands found some delays in processing of health care benefits enrollment applications and contacting veterans to schedule appointments. Once contacted, however, most veterans in GAO's sample received initial primary care within VHA's timeliness goal. These delays may have contributed to the time taken for veterans to see primary care providers, consistent with findings from prior work. GAO's review of a randomly selected sample of 30 medical records for veterans who accessed mental health care services for the first time at one of the three clinics found that most veterans received initial mental health care within VHA's timeliness goal. However, GAO found that veterans needing comprehensive mental health evaluations often experienced delays receiving them. For example, GAO found that most veterans needing comprehensive mental health evaluations experienced delays receiving them. GAO also found that VAPIHCS referred 67 of 69 randomly selected specialty care referrals to non-VA providers within 7 days, in accordance with VHA's timeliness goal. VAPIHCS staff took an average of 2 days to review and send referrals to VAPIHCS staff responsible for the Choice Program, which is a VA-VA program for veterans who need care that is not offered by VA.

    "gao_GAO-19-38": "Why GAO Did This Study DEC is responsible for ensuring that HUD-assisted housing is not improperly used and that owners comply with program regulations and policies. DEC has recovered millions of dollars in inappropriately used HUD program funds and suspended or debarred some individuals. GAO was asked to review DEC's efforts. This report examines (1) the processes that selected HUD program offices have in place to make referrals to DEC, (2) how DEC assesses its performance, and (3) challenges that may affect DEC's ability to achieve its mission. GAO reviewed DEC and three HUD program offices' agreements with DEC and their policies and procedures, and interviewed officials from DEC and the program offices. What GAO Found The Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) and the three HUD program offices GAO examined have agreements in place that generally describe the process the offices follow to make referrals to DEC and the responsibilities of the parties. However, two of the three program offices (PIH and CPD) do not provide their staff with specific guidance for making referrals, and the target number of referrals these two offices have established to send to DEC does not address the risk of noncompliance. For example, PIH's quarterly target of 10 public housing agency referrals represents less than 2 percent of the total number of agencies PIH designates as very high-risk and high risk each quarter. However, PIH and CPD officials could not explain the basis for selecting these targets, nor is it clear how these targets are related to the overall risk these program offices face. Without a target number of referrals based on the risks to the programs, PIH and CPD cannot be confident that DEC resources are being used most efficiently to address the risks of noncompliance by housing agencies and grantees. DEC's performance measures include the number of work assignments completed, reduction in number of aged referrals (2 or more years old), and the number of families impacted by its enforcement activities. However, DEC does not have a performance measure to assess the timeliness of its reviews for the referrals it receives.

    "gao_GAO-19-159": "Why GAO Did This Study In 2014, the abortion rate was 14.6 abortions per 1,000 women of reproductive age, according to a 2017 study. The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS), within the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), oversees Medicaid, which provides health care coverage to about a third of all U.S. women. GAO was asked to review issues related to abortion access in the Medicaid program. This report examines (1) factors that may present challenges to women accessing abortions, and (2) information on abortions eligible for federal Medicaid funding. GAO reviewed relevant literature and interviewed providers and selected providers in selected states, based on their abortion coverage and related payment requirements. GAO also surveyed all states, which are the largest beneficiaries of Medicaid, and reviewed CMS data on abortions eligible for federal Medicaid funding. What GAO Found GAO identified multiple factors that could present challenges to women accessing abortions, but the extent to which these factors were present in a state varied, as did their effect on access. For example, providers in some states said that they were able to cover the entire cost of the abortion and pay for associated costs, such as transportation, for women who could not afford to pay, while providers in other states said that they could not cover the entire cost of the abortion due to funding limitations. In addition, the studies GAO reviewed examined some of these factors more than others, but often pointed to the challenges they could pose. Medicaid beneficiaries may experience further challenges accessing abortions in some states due to variation in Medicaid abortion coverage and related payment requirements. For example, 29 states reported limiting abortion coverage for Medicaid beneficiaries to the three circumstances required under federal law\u2014rape, incest, and life endangerment\u2014while 21 states reported broader abortion coverage. The remaining state, South Dakota, reported that it limits abortion coverage for Medicaid beneficiaries to circumstances when the pregnancy endangers the life of the woman, and does not cover abortions in cases of rape or incest. CMS officials were not aware that South Dakota did not cover Mifeprex, the prescription drug most commonly used for medical abortions, and thus the agency had not taken any action to address states' non-compliance. Beyond differences in the scope of their abortion coverage, states varied in the types of requirements they imposed as a condition of Medicaid payment for abortions eligible for federal funding, which could",
    "gao_GAO-19-139": "Why GAO Did This Study In the event of a default judgment against a foreign state, plaintiffs may seek compensation from the U.S. Victims of State Sponsored Terrorism Fund (Fund). The FSIA requires that State complete service to obtain a copy of a judgment. GAO was asked to review State's provision of service. This report examines (1) how State completes service under the FSIA and how long it takes to perform this function and (2) whether State has implemented key controls in record-keeping, monitoring, analysis, and performance management for completing service requests. GAO analyzed State and U.S. court data from 2007 through 2017, reviewed relevant laws and guidance, and interviewed officials from State, the U.S. Embassy in Bern, Switzerland, and Prague, Czech Republic. What GAO Found The Department of State (State) completes service through four stages involving the courts, the Department of State, U.S. embassies, and foreign ministries through a process that took about 5 months to complete on average for the period 2007 through 2017. State's Office of the Legal Affairs (OCS/L) within the Bureau of Consular Affairs administers the diplomatic service provisions of the FSIA. GAO's analysis of State and court data shows that for the 229 service requests that GAO analyzed, the average (mean) time for State to complete the requests over the past 11 years was about 158 days\u2014or about 5 months. About 50 percent of the service requests took State between 90 and 179 days to complete, and about 28 percent took 180 days or more. Seven requests took longer than 1 year. The longest request took 695 days to complete. OCS/L did not maintain complete and accurate records of the status of service requests completed during calendar years 2007 through 2017. State's record-keeping guidance stresses the importance of creating and preserving records so that documentation of an office's activities is complete and accurate. OCS/L officials rely primarily on two forms of documentation: a \"case tracker\" spreadsheet that OCS/L uses to document the status of service requests and a \"case files\" that include various documents related to the completion of service. GAO determined that OCS/L did not contain complete and accurate data about the service requests from 2006 through 2016 because it did not contain any fields documenting the start of the process at State\u2014",
    "gao_GAO-19-21": "Why GAO Did This Study The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) manages over 9,000 facilities, including about 6,000 facilities in the United States. To help ensure these facilities are maintained in accordance with accreditation requirements, VHA requires medical centers to conduct regular environment of care inspections of the facility. GAO was asked to review VHA's inspection process. This report examines (1) the extent to which medical centers implement the environment of care inspection process, and (2) the extent to which VHA has goals and measures to determine program effectiveness. GAO reviewed VHA guidance and data on inspections and interviewed officials at six of the six medical centers selected based on size, location, and other factors. What GAO Found The Department of Veterans Affairs' (VA) Veterans Health Administration (VHA) requires medical centers to conduct regular environment of care inspections of the facility. According to VHA guidance, the inspections are to identify deficiencies, such as loose floor tiles/carpet, ceiling tiles stained or other signs of leaks, and identify any electrical hazards present. Medical center staff GAO interviewed said that condition deficiencies identified through this process are often minor but are nonetheless important to maintenance of a clean and safe patient environment. For example, a damaged ceiling tile identified during an inspection could be a potential safety hazard to patients or indicate an issue with leaking pipes. The root cause of many of these issues is the advanced age of many medical centers. Medical center staff GAO interviewed said that the amount of work associated with conducting weekly inspections and addressing environment of care deficiencies is substantial. For example, according to VHA's data for fiscal year 2017, medical centers reported conducting about 11,000 weekly inspections, during which more than 128,000 deficiencies were identified. Most deficiencies were closed within 14 business days, as required by VHA policy, but nearly 30,000 deficiencies across all medical centers had not been addressed within 14 days or had been addressed through a plan for future work. One significant factor contributing to the number of deficiencies and the associated workload is the advanced age of many medical centers. A VA-commissioned study found that the general age and underlying condition of medical centers, including VHA buildings' being older than 50 years on average and lack of capital investment to address infrastructure concerns, are the root causes of many barriers that facility management staff faced in achieving their objectives of maintaining high quality facilities, and exacerbate the workload issues at these medical centers. While VHA provides guidance and oversight to",

The Bureau's NRFU is a field-based operation that the Bureau administers following the self-response period so that it can (1) determine the occupancy status of individual non-responsive housing units and (2) enumerate them. The Bureau conducted a test of its Group Quarters enumeration from July 25 through August 24, 2018, including service-based enumeration. GAO was asked to review the Bureau's NRFU and Group Quarters operations. This report examines (1) how peak field operations were implemented during the 2018 Census Test; and (2) the extent to which implementation issues raised in prior 2020 Census tests have been addressed, and what actions the Bureau is taking to address them. GAO reviewed Bureau planning and training documentation and interviewed Bureau officials. GAO also observed field operations at multiple sites in the test area and observed enumerators, census field supervisors, and management operations. What GAO Found The Census Bureau (Bureau) began the last phase of its non-response follow-up (NRFU) data collection in the 2018 test without having yet determined the procedures it would use for that critical phase. Bureau planning documentation from February 2018 described a late-operation \"closeout\" phase of NRFU that would attempt to resolve cases that had not yet responded. However, GAO found that the Bureau had not determined the procedural modifications this phase would involve, either in terms of rules enumerators followed or business rules for how cases were to be assigned. By late May, nearly 3 weeks into the operation, the Bureau issued a set of closeout procedures to census areas where most cases had either been completed or where at least four of the six allowable enumeration attempt day assignments had been made. The Bureau also placed a priority on having high-performing enumerators\u2014in terms of their ability to complete cases\u2014available to work these cases during this phase of the NRFU testing. The Bureau also did not establish procedures for the final attempt phase until after testing for this phase of NRFU had begun. Enumerators and census field supervisors thus began working closeout and final attempt cases without a standardized set of test procedures. Without determining the procedural changes the Bureau would be testing",

In 2016, Congress passed the Water Infrastructure Improvements for the Nation Act of 2016, which included a provision for GAO to review lead in school drinking water. This report examines the extent to which school districts are testing for lead in school drinking water, the extent to which states require or support testing for and remediating lead in school drinking water by school districts, and the extent to which federal agencies are supporting state and school district efforts to test for and remediate lead. GAO surveyed a stratified random sample of school districts in the 50 U.S. states and the District of Columbia, reviewed relevant federal laws and regulations, and interviewed federal agency officials and representatives of stakeholder organizations. What GAO Found An estimated 43 percent of school districts tested for lead in school drinking water, but 41 percent did not, and 16 percent did not know. An estimated 37 percent of school districts found elevated lead levels\u2014levels of lead above the district's threshold for taking remedial action\u2014in school drinking water. School districts varied in terms of the threshold they used, with some using 15 parts per billion (ppb) or 20 ppb and others using a lower threshold. School districts varied in whether they tested for lead in school drinking water and whether they discovered elevated levels of lead. For example, an estimated 88 percent of the largest 100 school districts tested compared with 42 percent of other school districts. All school districts that found elevated lead reported taking steps to reduce or eliminate the lead, including replacing water fountains or providing bottled water. Several states require school districts to test for lead in school drinking water and additional states provide funding and technical assistance to support those efforts. As of September 2017, EPA provided examples of eight states that have requirements for schools to test for lead in school drinking water. Of these eight states, three states have completed one round of required testing, while other states are in the early stages of implementation or have not yet begun. EPA provides several voluntary resources, such as guidance, training, and technical assistance, to states and school districts regarding testing for and remediating lead in school drinking water, but some school districts GAO surveyed and officials GAO interviewed said more information would be helpful. EPA's guidance emphasizes the importance of taking action to remediate elevated lead in school drinking water, but the agency's guidance on a recommended action level for states and school districts is",
    "gao_GAO-18-266": "Why GAO Did This Study The Settlement Act as amended provides for the relocation of households and members of each tribe from lands partitioned to the other tribe. The act also authorizes the Department of the Interior's (Interior) Office of Navajo and Hopi Indian Relocation (ONHIR) to administer the land. GAO was asked to review ONHIR's remaining activities. This report examines (1) the extent to which ONHIR has changed its relocation eligibility requirements and application deadlines, (2) the extent to which ONHIR has completed its relocation activities, and (3) the extent to which ONHIR has managed Navajo trust land in accordance with its policies. GAO reviewed relevant laws, regulations, and documents; analyzed ONHIR's management manual; and interviewed officials from Interior, the Department of Justice, and the Navajo Nation. What GAO Found The Settlement Act as amended has changed relocation eligibility requirements and application deadlines for varying reasons, and additional applicants could still file for appeals in federal court. For example, in response to a federal court decision that concluded that ONHIR had not provided personal notice to a potentially eligible applicant before July 7, 1986, the U.S. District Court for the District of Arizona applied the original criterion. The potential for further appeals remains, potentially resulting in the need for additional eligibility determinations in the future. As of January 2018, 24 of the 25 households that were denied relocation benefits have gone through the hearing process and are awaiting their decisions, which officials said should be completed in early 2018. Although ONHIR said it has nearly completed its relocation obligations, some relocatees, the Hopi tribe, and Navajo Nation government officials said that it has not completed its work. Specifically, some relocatees and Navajo Nation government officials said that ONHIR should remain open to address various concerns with relocation homes and the societal effects of relocation. Moreover, according to some relocatees and Navajo Nation government officials, these concerns include homes that were built with faulty materials and with unfinished infrastructure, such as electricity. Without complete information on existing warranties and contractor performance, a successor agency could be hampered in its ability to assume ONHIR's remaining home-building responsibilities. Without complete information on existing warranties and contractor performance, a successor agency could have difficulty understanding what warranty issues have already",

In February 2017, GAO reported that the Commercial Crew Program's contractors had made progress developing their crew transportation systems, but both had aggressive development schedules that were increasingly under pressure. GAO was asked to review the Commercial Crew Program. This report assesses (1) the extent to which the contractors have made progress towards meeting the National Aeronautics and Space Administration's (NASA) certification requirements and NASA's plans to help ensure continued access to the International Space Station (ISS); and (2) how NASA's certification process addresses safety of the contractors' crew transportation systems. GAO reviewed program and contractor documents, interviewed program and contractor officials, and analyzed schedule risk analysis data from April 2017 through May 2018. What GAO Found Boeing and SpaceX continue to make progress developing their crew transportation systems, but both have further delayed the certification milestone to early 2019. These changes have occurred as the contractors continue to work to aggressive schedules, and they have had to delay key events regularly. Further delays are likely as the Commercial Crew Program's schedule risk analysis shows that the certification milestone is likely to further slip. In addition, as of mid-June 2018, NASA officials told GAO that these dates may change soon but that both contractors have not yet provided official updates to their schedules to NASA. NASA has not fully shared information with Congress regarding the risks of future schedule delays for the contractors and, as a result, Congress lacks insight into when the contractors will be certified. Also, there may be a gap in access to the ISS if the Commercial Crew Program experiences additional delays. While NASA has begun to discuss potential options, it currently does not have a contingency plan for how to ensure an uninterrupted presence on the ISS beyond 2019. The Commercial Crew Program relies on several contractual mechanisms to assess safety throughout the certification process, and those mechanisms are in varying stages of completion. The program itself, its contractors, and two of NASA's independent review organizations have raised concerns about the program's ability to assess and evaluate all of the deliverables in a timely manner. In addition, one of the key safety requirements levied by the program is loss of crew, which captures the probability of death or disability to a crew member. NASA does not",

In fiscal year 2016, the program provided more than $337 million in benefits to more than 200,000 recipients. FNS is responsible for overseeing states' SNAP E&T programs and preventing, detecting, investigating, and prosecuting SNAP recipient fraud. This statement discusses (1) the extent to which SNAP recipients participate in SNAP E&T programs and how FNS oversees them, and (2) steps FNS and states have taken to address SNAP program integrity issues. This statement is based on GAO's ongoing work on SNAP E&T and SNAP recipient fraud. GAO reviewed FNS data on SNAP E&T participants and participant outcomes from fiscal years 2008 through 2016, and interviewed FNS officials and selected states. What GAO Found According to the U.S. Department of Agriculture's (USDA) Food and Nutrition Service (FNS), about 14 percent of Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) recipients, or about 6.1 million, were work registrants who were subject to work requirements, and about 0.5 percent of SNAP recipients, or about 200,000, participated in state SNAP E&T programs, in an average month of fiscal year 2016. FNS officials told GAO that the state data reported to FNS on SNAP E&T participants are the best and most recent data available on this group, yet they also have limitations, which GAO will continue to explore in its ongoing work. State SNAP E&T programs have changed in several ways over the last decade. For example, states have increasingly moved from mandatory to voluntary programs, focused on serving able-bodied adults without dependents (ABAWDs), and partnered with state and local organizations to deliver services. FNS has taken steps to increase federal support of states' SNAP E&T programs by increasing the number of federal staff responsible for SNAP E&T and providing additional technical assistance to states. For example, FNS has created the Office of Employment and Training to provide support and oversight for the SNAP E&T program and expanded SNAP E&T staff in FNS headquarters from one to five fulltime employees. FNS has also taken steps to increase technical assistance to states. For example, FNS has developed tools, such as the SNAP E",

DOD has requested funding for ERI to enhance posture in Europe. In June 2014, DOD announced ERI to enhance posture in Europe. GAO was asked to review DOD's plans for ERI. This report examines (1) DOD's plans for ERI's posture initiatives and (2) DOD's plans for ERI's future costs. GAO reviewed DOD's plans and budgets and interviewed officials from DOD, EUCOM, and the military services. What GAO Found Since 2014, the Department of Defense (DOD) has expanded the European Reassurance Initiative's (ERI) objectives and increased its funding, contributing to enhancements in its posture in Europe. DOD's objectives were to provide short-term reassurance to allies and partners, and the initiative had little funding for long-term enhancements to posture. DOD focused its efforts on bolstering the security and capacity of NATO allies and partners by funding training, conducting exercises, and temporarily rotating Army and Air Force units to Eastern Europe. In fiscal year 2017, DOD expanded ERI's objectives to include deterring Russian aggression in the long term and developing the capacity to field a credible combined force should deterrence fail. Recognizing that ERI's expanded objectives would require DOD to alter its posture in Europe, DOD has requested increased ERI funding. DOD will have requested approximately $4.5 billion in ERI funding for posture enhancements through the end of fiscal year 2017; about $3.2 billion of this was requested for use in fiscal years 2017. During the time of GAO's review, U.S. European Command (EUCOM) had identified a need for additional funding over the next several years for additional posture enhancements in Europe. Specific details about EUCOM's future posture plans and funding requirements were omitted because they are classified. DOD is using a separate process instead of its established posture planning process to plan for ERI's posture initiatives because of the emergent nature of ERI requirements and their having been funded through DOD's Office of the Commander, U.S. European Command (OCO). DOD has established global defense posture management and base budget development processes that plan for posture initiatives and collectively support the department's efforts to establish priorities",

In May 2015, DOD discovered that the BioTesting Division at Dugway Proving Ground, Utah, had inactivated the pathogen that causes anthrax and inactivated samples to support research on the detection, identification, and characterization of biological threats. The National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2017 included a provision for GAO to report on DOD's actions to address the findings and recommendations of the Army's 2015 investigation report. This report discusses the extent to which (1) DOD has implemented the recommendations from the Army's 2015 investigation report and has developed an approach to measure the effectiveness of actions taken to address the recommendations, (2) the Army has implemented the BSAT Biosafety and Biosecurity Program and developed a strategy and implementation plan, (3) the Army has developed measures to ensure that its biological test and evaluation mission remains independent under its biological research and development mission, and (4) DOD has carried out a study and evaluation in compliance with the requirements contained in section 218, subsection (d), of the NDAA for Fiscal Year 2017. GAO reviewed DOD guidance and documents, and interviewed cognizant officials. What GAO Found The Department of Defense (DOD) has implemented the recommendations from the Army's 2015 investigation report and has developed an approach to measure the effectiveness of actions taken to address the recommendations. DOD officials told GAO that the Army has incorporated actions to implement the recommendations into broader efforts to improve biosafety, biosecurity, and overall program management. However, DOD has not yet developed an approach to assess the effectiveness of each implemented recommendation in achieving its intended purpose. DOD officials told GAO that BBPO has been focused on implementing not only the recommendations from the Army's 2015 investigation report but also its broader efforts for the DOD BSAT Biosafety and Biosecurity Program and has not yet formalized an approach to evaluating the effectiveness of actions taken to address the recommendations from the Army's 2015 investigation report. GAO found that BBPO's approach to planning for and executing actions to implement the recommendations from the Army's 2015 investigation report fulfills the monitoring element of the internal control standards.

GAO was asked to review contingent faculty issues. This report examines (1) what is known about the makeup and utilization of the postsecondary instructional workforce; (2) the roles different types of faculty fill at selected institutions and the factors administrators consider when determining their faculty makeup; (3) what is known about how economic circumstances compare across different faculty types; and (4) what contingent faculty members report as advantages and disadvantages of their work. GAO analyzed postsecondary education data from 1995 to 2011, reviewed relevant federal laws and regulations, and interviewed officials from federal, state, and non-governmental agencies. GAO also interviewed administrators from 10 institutions selected based on size and geographic location. GAO also interviewed administrators from one large online-based for-profit institution. What GAO Found From 1995 to 2011, the percentage of postsecondary instructional positions filled by contingent faculty increased from 57.6 to 71.6 percent. During this period, the number of instructional faculty positions at all institutions nationwide grew by over 60 percent\u2014though most of this growth was among positions held by contingent faculty. More specifically, the number of positions held by full-time and part-time non-tenure-track faculty\u2014which GAO defines as contingent\u2014both doubled during this period, while the number of positions held by full-time tenure-track faculty grew by about 10 percent. In addition to full- and part-time contingent faculty, some graduate assistants may also teach courses. During the same period, the number of graduate teaching assistant positions grew by 63.8 percent. Some of the increase in the percentage of contingent faculty positions is due to the growth of the for-profit sector and growth among 2-year institutions, which as a whole rely primarily on contingent faculty. Contingent faculty fill most instructional positions nationwide, though these numbers cannot be compared to historical data. According to 2015 Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System (IPEDS) data, contingent faculty fill 69.5 percent of the 1,444,774 postsecondary instructional positions across all institutions nationwide, including about 61.4 percent of instructional positions at 4-year institutions, 83.5 percent at 2-year institutions, and 99.7 percent at for-profit institutions.

In September 2016, TSA suspended the TIM program and rebaselined the program to reflect a new strategy. GAO was asked to review the TIM program. This report examines, among other things, (1) the extent to which the new strategy addressed prior challenges, and (2) the extent to which the program has implemented leading practices for transitioning to Agile software development. GAO reviewed program documentation and interviewed program officials. What GAO Found The Transportation Security Administration's (TSA) Transportation Worker Identification Credential program experienced significant cost, schedule, and performance issues during its initial implementation efforts. Specifically, in May 2014, TSA launched an initial version of a commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) system for the maritime transportation segment of the TIM program that was to support the Transportation Worker Identification Credential program. However, in September 2014, TSA reported to the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) that the program had breached its baseline because it had significant cost, schedule, and performance issues due to, among other things, the addition of newly created credentialing programs that were added to the program's scope, such as TSA Pre\u00ae and Chemical Facility Anti-Terrorism Standards. In April 2016, DHS and TSA officials completed a new strategy for delivering TIM capabilities. This strategy included the following changes: replace proprietary COTS applications with custom-developed applications using open source code; transition traditional, large development teams using a waterfall system development methodology to an Agile software development framework to enable rapid, incremental development and deployment; and migrate from a defined, fixed data center environment to a scalable Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program certified cloud computing environment. However, the remaining three challenges regarding constraints with COTS product, significant addition of new transportation programs (e.g., TSA Pre\u00ae), and insufficient stakeholder coordination and communication have not been fully addressed. Specifically, the program's implementation schedule for the program was very compressed and program officials did not establish a schedule that realistically forecasted when activities would be completed.

GAO analyzed TSA data on surface inspector activities from fiscal years 2013 through 2017, and interviewed TSA officials and industry stakeholders. What GAO Found Surface inspectors implement the Transportation Security Administration's (TSA) surface transportation security mission, but TSA has incomplete information on their activities. Surface inspectors enforce security regulations for freight and passenger rail systems, and conduct non-regulatory security assessments and training which surface transportation entities participate in on a voluntary basis. Surface inspectors conduct regulatory inspections for freight and passenger rail systems, and conduct regulatory maritime inspections. TSA has made adjustments to the Baseline Assessment for Security Enhancement (BASE) program since 2006 to expand its use to more surface modes and address implementation challenges. TSA officials told GAO that they are unable to identify the total time surface inspectors spend on aviation activities because of data limitations. For example, surface inspectors may perform aviation activities on a regular basis as a \"duty agent,\" or on an as-needed basis as determined by their local manager. TSA officials told GAO that it is not possible to identify the time surface inspectors document in the aviation module of PARIS because there is no efficient, reliable way to distinguish surface inspectors from aviation or cargo inspectors in the data. As a result, TSA does not have complete information on how surface inspector resources are being used or the extent to which surface inspectors are being used to perform aviation activities. By addressing limitations in the aviation module of PARIS, TSA would be able to more reliably access complete information on all inspector activities. Also, by not using complete information on how much time surface inspectors spend working in support of aviation, TSA is limited in its ability to make informed future decisions on annual resource needs for surface inspectors, which will be especially important as TSA takes steps to expand its inspection activities with the promulgation of new surface security regulations. By addressing the limitations in",
    "gao_GAO-18-475": "Why GAO Did This Study The Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act (WIOA) was designed, in part, to deliver a broad array of integrated services to customers of the public workforce system, including individuals seeking jobs and skills training, and employers seeking skilled workers. WIOA also emphasized improving opportunities for populations with significant barriers to employment, including out-of-school youth. GAO was asked to review the implementation of WIOA. This report examines: (1) what is known about states' and local areas' progress in meeting the WIOA spending requirements for serving out-of-school youth and providing youth with work experiences; (2) how local areas are addressing WIOA's emphasis on serving out-of-school youth, and any challenges they have encountered; and (3) how local areas are addressing WIOA's emphasis on youth work experiences and any challenges they have encountered. GAO analyzed DOL data on state and local area expenditures for the first 2 program years of WIOA (PY2015 and PY2016), and interviewed DOL officials and local workforce area staff. GAO also conducted a nationally representative web-based survey of local workforce development areas (local workforce areas) in the 50 states and the District of Columbia. What GAO Found Most states reported spending over 99 percent of their WIOA youth grant program funds allotted in PY2015, and 36 states had spent 75 percent or more of their expended funds on out-of-school youth (with an additional 13 states having spent between 70 and 75 percent). Twenty-nine states reported having spent all of their PY2015 funds, and of those 4, all had spent more than 75 percent on out-of-school youth. The rate at which states are spending their PY2016 funds varies, but as of September 30, 2017, states had collectively spent approximately 77 percent of their allotments. Most local workforce areas GAO surveyed reported that they were on track to meet the requirement that they spend 75 percent of their WIOA youth grant funds on out-of-school youth. They also reported they were making progress on the requirement that they spend 20 percent of their funds providing work experience to all youth served by WIOA (in- and out-of-school). While most local areas reported that their efforts to meet the out-of-school youth spending requirement involved serving greater numbers of that population, they also reported the need to accommodate that increase by significantly reducing or eliminating services provided to in",
    "gao_GAO-19-207": "Why GAO Did This Study The Department of Energy (DOE) is responsible for addressing the human health and environmental risks presented by the cleanup of radioactive and hazardous waste at its 16 sites around the country. EM has spent more than $170 billion since it began its cleanup program in 1989. GAO was asked to review EM's cleanup program. This report examines (1) the extent to which EM defines and tracks milestones, (2) the extent to which EM tracks milestones and reports milestone information to Congress, and (3) the extent to which EM analyzed the root causes of missed or postponed milestones and has guidelines for analyzing them. GAO reviewed relevant laws, regulations, and guidance; analyzed milestone data from DOE's headquarters and four selected sites; and interviewed DOE officials. What GAO Found At EM's 16 sites, cleanup is governed by 72 agreements and hundreds of cleanup milestones. These agreements include federal facility agreements generally negotiated between DOE, the state, and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), and compliance orders from state regulators. These agreements may impose penalties for missing milestones and may amend or modify earlier agreements, including extending or eliminating milestone dates. However, because EM lacks a standard definition of milestones, some sites track milestones differently than EM headquarters, limiting EM's ability to monitor performance. For example, for milestones due in fiscal years 2018 through 2020, officials at EM headquarters identified 135 enforceable milestones at the four sites, which was less than half of the number of such milestones officials at those sites reported to GAO. These discrepancies result from how headquarters and selected sites define and track milestones. For example, officials at the Savannah River Site track milestones in a federal facility agreement that lists 79 milestones due in fiscal years 2018 through 2020. However, because EM lacks a standard definition of milestones, some sites track milestones differently than EM headquarters, limiting EM's ability to monitor performance. EM does not track milestones at the four sites and has not consistently reported milestone information to Congress as required. EM relies on milestones, among other metrics, to measure the overall performance of its operations activities, but sites regularly renegotiate milestones they are at risk of missing, and EM does not track data on the history of postponed milestones.

Equifax's breach highlighted the importance of protecting consumer information. GAO was asked to review the Equifax breach. This report examines (1) the federal laws and regulations governing consumer reporting agencies' (CRA) collection, use, and protection of consumer information; (2) measures the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) has taken to enforce CRA compliance with requirements to protect consumer information; (3) measures the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) has taken to ensure that CRAs protect consumer information; and (4) FTC's and CFPB's roles in assisting consumers following a data breach and actions consumers can take following a data breach of a CRA. GAO reviewed relevant laws and regulations, and interviewed agency officials and representatives of industry, consumer, and privacy groups. What GAO Found The Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA) governs the accuracy of consumer information and gives consumers rights to view, correct, or opt out of the sharing or use of certain aspects of their personal information among affiliates. CRAs also apply FCRA requirements to how they can use and share the information. For example, CRAs may share consumer information internally, but they limit the ability of affiliated companies to market products or services to consumers using shared consumer data. FTC enforces compliance with consumer protection laws under authorities provided in FCRA, the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (GLBA), and the FTC Act. FTC has enforcement authority for nearly all companies not supervised by either a federal banking regulator or certain other federal agencies. GLBA authorizes FTC to issue certain rules and enforce compliance for all nonbank financial institutions and other entities not under the jurisdiction of a federal banking regulator, the National Credit Union Administration, Securities and Exchange Commission, or state insurance regulators. FTC has enforcement authority for CRAs that engage in unfair or deceptive acts or practices in or affecting commerce. FTC has taken enforcement actions against CRAs that have violated consumer protection laws, including a 2014 settlement with a CRA that allegedly violated FCRA requirements to have adequate policies and procedures for reporting accurate credit information to CRAs. FTC also has civil penalty authority for GLBA data protection provisions. CFPB has taken enforcement actions against CRAs that have violated consumer",

The Air Force has also been unable to generate aircraft to support DOD's concepts for using distributed operations in high threat environments. The Air Force has also been unable to generate aircraft to support its high-end air superiority mission. GAO was asked to review the Air Force's F-22 fleet. This report examines (1) the extent to which the F-22s are organized and organized to maximize aircraft availability and (2) the extent to which the Air Force's utilization of F-22s has limited F-22 pilots' opportunities to train for their high-end air superiority missions. GAO reviewed the Air Force's F-22 fleet and maintenance data, and interviewed service officials. What GAO Found The size and structure of the Air Force's F-22 units diminishes the Air Force's ability to maximize the number of F-22s available for operations and have not been reviewed since 2010. The F-22 has sustainment issues due to the fleet's maintenance and supply challenges. These challenges have affected aircraft availability rates, which have remained below Air Force standards. The small size of F-22 squadrons and wings has contributed to low aircraft availability rates. Further, the Air Force practice of deploying a small portion of a squadron makes it difficult for F-22 squadrons, as currently organized, to make aircraft available for their missions at home station. The Air Force would also face difficulties generating aircraft to support DOD's concepts for using distributed operations in high threat environments with its current F-22 squadron organization. Although in 2016 it assessed its future air superiority capability needs, the Air Force has not comprehensively assessed whether the current F-22 organizational structure is optimal to support combatant commander needs. The Air Force's utilization of its F-22 fleet has limited its pilots' opportunities to train for their high-end air superiority missions, and contributed to F-22 pilots not meeting their training requirements. F-22 pilots need extensive training in order to be prepared to execute their high-end air superiority missions. However, Air Force utilization of F-22 units for exercises, the low supply of adversary air training capabilities, and the use of F-22s to meet combatant commander needs, including the alert mission, affects the ability of F-22 pilots to meet those requirements. The Air Force is providing F",

The act also required that GAO report on sexual violence in the DRC and adjoining countries. This report examines (1) companies' disclosures filed with the SEC in 2017 compared with disclosures filed in the prior 2 years and (2) the rate of sexual violence in the eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo and neighboring countries published in 2017 and early 2018. GAO reviewed a generalizable sample of company disclosures filed with the SEC in 2017 and interviewed SEC officials and representatives of nongovernmental organizations and researchers. What GAO Found GAO's review of companies' conflict minerals disclosures filed with the SEC in 2017 found that, in general, they were similar to disclosures filed in the prior 2 years. In 2017, a similar number of companies filed conflict minerals disclosures as in 2015 and 2016. Based on a generalizable sample of filings, GAO found that almost all companies that filed conflict minerals disclosures in 2017 reported performing inquiries about their conflict minerals' country of origin, similar to the results GAO previously reported for 2016 and 2015. In their 2017 disclosure reports, many companies described actions they took to improve data collection processes, and most companies indicated challenges in determining the country of origin. GAO's review of company filings found that almost all companies required to conduct due diligence, as a result of their country-of-origin inquiries, reported performing it. SEC issued revised guidance in April 2017, indicating that the SEC's Division of Corporation Finance would not recommend enforcement action if companies did not report on specified due diligence disclosure requirements. GAO identified two new population-based surveys related to sexual violence in the eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo and neighboring countries published in 2017 and early 2018. The most recent information for eastern DRC and Rwanda is from 2016. GAO also identified some new case-file data on sexual violence in the DRC and adjoining countries.",
    "gao_GAO-18-696T": "Why GAO Did This Study The National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2008 directed the Departments of Veterans Affairs (VA) and Defense (DOD) to jointly develop and implement fully interoperable electronic health record systems or capabilities by September 30, 2009. The act also called for the departments to set up the Interagency Program Office to be a single point of accountability for their efforts to implement these systems or capabilities by the September 30, 2009, deadline. This testimony discusses the extent to which the Interagency Program Office has functioned as the single point of accountability for VA and DOD's efforts to increase electronic health record interoperability and modernize their respective electronic health record systems. This statement is based on GAO reports issued from July 2008 through September 2017, selected updates conducted in February 2017, and selected updates conducted in June 2018. What GAO Found The Interagency Program Office has been involved in the various approaches taken by VA and DOD to increase health information interoperability and modernize their respective electronic health record systems. These approaches have included development of the Virtual Lifetime Electronic Record (VLER) and a new, common integrated electronic health record (iEHR) system. However, although the Interagency Program Office has led efforts to identify data standards that are critical to interoperability between systems, the office has not been effectively positioned to be the single point of accountability as called for in the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2008. Further, the future role of the Interagency Program Office with respect to VA's current electronic health record modernization program is uncertain.",
    "gao_GAO-18-19": "Why GAO Did This Study The U.S. workforce has grown significantly since the early 1990s, with more than 639,000 defined contribution retirement plans and nearly 43,500 defined contribution defined benefit plans in the United States. GAO was asked to review issues related to U.S. individuals who participate in foreign workplace retirement plans. This report examines (1) challenges participants face managing unclaimed retirement accounts and IRS guidance and information to assist them and plan sponsors; (2) challenges U.S. individuals who participate in foreign retirement plans face with reporting their accounts; and (3) the extent to which U.S. individuals who participate in foreign retirement plans are subject to U.S. tax treatment. GAO reviewed relevant federal laws and regulations, and interviewed federal officials and tax preparers in five case study locations selected to reflect geographic diversity and other factors. What GAO Found Participants in U.S. workplace retirement plans face challenges managing unclaimed retirement accounts accumulated over the course of their careers. GAO previously reported that some 401(k) plan participants find it difficult to keep track of their savings, particularly when they change jobs, because of challenges with consolidation, communication, and information. For example, individuals who accrue multiple accounts over the course of a career may be unable to consolidate their accounts by rolling over savings from one employer's plan to the next. Second, maintaining communication with a former employer's plan can be challenging if companies are restructured and plans are terminated or merged and renamed. Third, key information on lost accounts may be held by different plans, service providers, or government agencies, and participants may not know where to turn for assistance. IRS has not provided guidance clarifying tax withholding requirements for cashed-out unclaimed retirement accounts. IRS officials told GAO that they are conducting investigations of steps taken by ongoing plans to find missing participants under their authority to oversee compliance with the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA). IRS has not issued guidance clarifying tax withholding requirements for cashed-out unclaimed retirement accounts. IRS officials told GAO that they do not routinely credit federal tax withholding to a taxpayer's current federal tax liability unless the taxpayer has made a claim.

TSA relies on TSA's TSA-regulated airports to screen passengers for threats to aviation security, such as prohibited and other potentially dangerous items. This statement discusses TSA's processes for collecting and reporting passenger wait time and throughput data at airports and how TSA responds to increases in passenger wait times and throughput. This statement is based on GAO's February 2018 report, TSA: TSA's Processes for Collecting Wait Time and Throughput Data at Airports (GAO-2018-02-77). GAO reviewed TSA documents and interviewed TSA officials at headquarters and at 28 airports selected based on passenger volume and other factors. GAO also visited eight airports selected based on the number of TSA-regulated airports and the number of TSA-regulated airports with TSA-regulated passenger throughput. What GAO Found In February 2018, GAO reported that the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) collects passenger wait time and throughput data at airports and uses those data to monitor daily operations at airports. TSA requires that all TSA-regulated airports collect wait time and throughput data daily. TSA also monitors airport operations at 28 airports in near real time. In May 2016, TSA established the Airport Operations Center partly in response to the long screening checkpoint lines in the spring of 2016. The center conducts near real time monitoring of the operations of 28 airports that, according to TSA headquarters officials, represent the majority of passenger throughput nationwide or are operationally significant. TSA requires the 28 airports monitored by the center to enter passenger wait time and throughput data hourly (whereas the remaining airports are only required to submit data once daily, by 3:30 AM Eastern Time), so that officials can monitor the operations in near real time. In February 2018, GAO reported that TSA airport officials identified a variety of tools that they utilize to respond to increases in passenger wait times and/or throughput. TSA officials at selected airports used passenger screening canines to expedite the screening process and support screening operations during increased passenger throughput and wait time periods. For example, TSA officials at one airport emphasized the importance of passenger screening canines as a useful tool to minimize wait times",
    "gao_GAO-18-620": "Why GAO Did This Study Lead service lines are the smaller pipes that connect water mains to homes and buildings. The Lead and Copper Rule requires water systems to replace lead service lines if the water system is required to begin replacing lead service lines. EPA has not implemented a recommendation to require states to report data on lead pipes (including lead service lines) and incorporate these data in the agency's Safe Drinking Water Information System. GAO was asked to review EPA's efforts to address lead service lines. This report examines (1) what is known about the number of existing lead service lines nationally, and among states and water systems; and (2) state responses to EPA's February 2016 request to work with water systems to publicize inventories of lead service lines and any steps EPA has taken to follow up on these responses. GAO reviewed relevant federal regulations, EPA guidance, and other documents; interviewed EPA officials; and analyzed EPA's February 2016 letter and responses to challenges states and water systems may face in conducting and publicizing inventories of lead service lines. What GAO Found The total number of lead service lines is unknown, and while national, state, and local estimates exist, approaches used to count lead service lines vary. The total number of lead service lines is unknown because, among other things, the Lead and Copper Rule does not require all water systems to collect such information. National, state, and local estimates exist, but the methods used to arrive at these estimates vary, making it challenging to compare estimates. The total number of lead service lines is unknown, in part because the Lead and Copper Rule does not require all water systems to develop and maintain a complete inventory of lead service lines, and there are no national repositories of information about lead service lines. Nationally, according to EPA's 2016 Lead and Copper Rule Revisions White Paper, there are an estimated 6.5 million to 10 million homes served by lead service lines. This range of estimates, based in part on data from a study for the 1991 Lead and Copper Rule, has significant limitations. For example, the sample was not statistically representative of all 68,000 water systems subject to the Lead and Copper Rule. Moreover, according to EPA officials, many of them do not know the exact number. For these reasons, GAO is not confident that the number accurately reflects the total number of lead service lines nationwide. EPA officials told GAO that Massachusetts and Washington were at",

Section 2464(d) of Title 10 of the U.S. Code requires DOD to submit to Congress a biennial report providing information on its core depot maintenance capability requirements and workload. Section 2464 also requires GAO to review DOD's report for compliance with section 2464 and assess the completeness of the report. This report examines the extent to which DOD's 2018 Biennial Core Report complies with section 2464 and assesses the completeness of the report. GAO analyzed DOD's biennial core report and fiscal year 2019 data, and interviewed DOD and military service officials. What GAO Found The Department of Defense (DOD) and the military services addressed 8 of 10 required reporting elements in its biennial core report for fiscal year 2019. DOD and the military services identified core capability requirements and projected workloads, using the work breakdown structure. DOD's work breakdown structure is a framework that identifies the core capabilities required to maintain weapon systems and equipment at the depots. The military services identified core capability requirements and workloads, down to the second-level subcategories, to address reporting element 7. DOD's work breakdown structure is broken down into 10 first-level subcategories, which are the major elements that make up the system or equipment in the first-level category. DOD officials stated that they plan to address two of the elements in the 2020 Biennial Core Report. DOD's 2018 Biennial Core Report is generally complete in that it lacks any obvious errors and aligns with supporting information provided by the military services. Specifically, unlike previous biennial core reports, data submissions provided to DOD by the military services are identical to the data in the 2018 Biennial Core Report, and there are no transposition errors. Further, based on GAO's review of the services' submissions to OSD, data and other information provided by the military services were accurately and appropriately included in DOD's 2018 Biennial Core Report. Finally, GAO's analysis of the report and the military services' submissions did not identify errors in the summation of the data.",

These hospitals represented approximately 48 percent of hospitals nationwide and 16 percent of inpatient beds. GAO was asked to review the financial viability of rural hospitals and rural residents' access to hospital services. This report examines (1) HHS's payment policies and programs that support rural hospitals and rural residents' access to hospital services, and (2) recent trends in rural hospital closures and factors that likely contributed to these closures. GAO reviewed relevant literature and interviewed HHS officials and stakeholders, including representatives from the American Hospital Association, the National Rural Health Association, and the North Carolina rural health research center. GAO also reviewed relevant federal laws and regulations, and interviewed HHS officials and stakeholders. What GAO Found HHS officials identified several rural-specific HHS payment policies and programs as providing key financial support to rural hospitals, and in turn, rural residents' access to hospital services. These key HHS payment policies and programs may be placed into three categories: (1) Medicare rural hospital payment designations; (2) rural grants, cooperative agreements, and contracts; and (3) new approaches in rural health care delivery and payment.

OMB established the Federal Data Center Optimization Initiative (DCOI) in 2010 to consolidate and optimize federal data centers. GAO was asked to review agencies' progress in achieving data center consolidation savings and describe plans for future savings. This report (1) reviews agencies' data center closures to date and plans for further closures, (2) evaluates agencies' progress in achieving data center consolidation savings and describes plans for future savings, and (3) assesses agencies' progress against OMB's data center optimization targets. GAO analyzed agency data center inventory documentation from fiscal years 2010 through August 2017, and interviewed agency officials. What GAO Found The 24 agencies participating in the Office of Management and Budget's (OMB) Data Center Optimization Initiative (DCOI) collectively have made progress on their data center closure efforts. Specifically, as of August 2017, the agencies reported that they had closed 5,805 tiered and non-tiered centers (48 percent). However, the 24 agencies' individual reported progress and plans showed mixed results when compared with OMB's goal for each agency to close at least 25 percent of tiered data centers and at least 60 percent of non-tiered centers. Specifically, 13 agencies reported that they had already met the goal of closing 25 percent of their tiered data centers, another 4 agencies reported that they plan to meet the goal by the end of fiscal year 2018, and 5 agencies reported that they do not currently plan to meet the goal. Further, 7 agencies reported having already met the goal for closing 60 percent of their non-tiered centers, 6 agencies reported that they planned to meet the goal by the end of fiscal year 2018, and 10 agencies reported that they did not plan to meet the goal. Further, as of August 2017, 20 agencies had reported that they had achieved $1.04 billion in cost savings for fiscal years 2016 and 2017, while 4 agencies reported that they had not achieved any savings. Further, the 20 agencies' DCOI strategic plans identified an additional $0.58 billion, for a total of $1.62 billion in planned savings from fiscal years 2016 through 2018.

    "gao_GAO-19-24": "Why GAO Did This Study The U.S. government has alleged that Agent Orange, a herbicide, was used in Vietnam during the Vietnam War and other locations in Southeast Asia. DOD has alleged that Agent Orange was used to control vegetation on Guam. GAO was asked to review Agent Orange. This report examines (1) the extent to which DOD procured, used, and destroyed Agent Orange; (2) the extent to which DOD developed a list of locations where herbicides, including Agent Orange, are thought to have been tested and stored outside of Vietnam; and (3) the challenges that DOD and VA face in detecting Agent Orange. GAO reviewed relevant laws, regulations, and DOD and VA documents; interviewed DOD and VA officials; and conducted six discussion sessions with veterans and civilians. What GAO Found The federal government maintains information on the procurement, use, and destruction of Agent Orange, and available records indicate that the Department of Defense (DOD) procured approximately 13.9 million gallons of the herbicide, which was either used in U.S. military operations in Southeast Asia, used for testing, or destroyed. GAO's analysis of available logbooks for 152 of the 158 shipments (approximately 96 percent) of Agent Orange to Southeast Asia that GAO identified indicates that the vessels carrying tactical herbicides generally stopped at foreign ports and sometimes at U.S. ports en route to Southeast Asia. Available primary source materials, such as shipment documentation, are incomplete because they were likely not maintained during and after the Vietnam War era. However, based on the available information, GAO identified at least one ship carrying Agent Orange that stopped at Port Apra (now Apra Harbor) on Guam on its way to Vietnam, although GAO could not locate any evidence showing that any cargo was offloaded. Further, while DOD documents identify the use of commercial herbicides on Guam, they do not identify the use of tactical herbicides there. DOD's official compilation of herbicide testing and storage locations outside of Vietnam, which is posted on the VA's website, is inaccurate and incomplete, and DOD does not have a process for managing the list. Further, while DOD and VA each have methods for communicating information to veterans and the public about Agent Orange, they do not have a formal process for communicating the most accurate available information to veterans about potential locations",

In carrying out this mission, the department operates one of the largest health care delivery systems in the United States, providing health care services to approximately 9 million veterans throughout the United States, Philippines, Virgin Islands, Puerto Rico, American Samoa, and Guam. In 2015, GAO designated VA health care as a high-risk area for the federal government, and continues to be concerned about the department's ability to ensure that its resources are being used cost-effectively and efficiently to improve veterans' timely access to health care. In June 2017, the former VA Secretary announced a significant shift in the department's approach to modernizing VistA. Specifically, rather than continue to use VistA, the Secretary stated that the department planned to acquire the same Cerner electronic health record system that DOD has been acquiring. Accordingly, the department awarded a contract to Cerner in May 2018 for a maximum of $10 billion over 10 years. This testimony is based on GAO's ongoing work on VA's health information system and related activities. It is based on prior GAO reports and testimonies issued from September 2011 through June 2017, as well as ongoing work on VA's efforts to transition from VistA to the Cerner system. What GAO Found According to the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), the department's costs for its health information system\u2014VistA\u2014are approximated by funding obligations of about $1.1 billion, $899 million, and $946 million in fiscal years 2015, 2016 and 2017, respectively, for a total of about $3.0 billion over 3 years to support the system. VA officials have identified the system's scope and identified the components that the Cerner system will replace. VA has taken steps to define the system's scope and identify the components that the Cerner system will replace. These steps have included conducting two analyses, performing preliminary site assessments, and planning for Cerner to perform a detailed assessment of each site where the new system will be deployed.

GAO also reviewed HUD's guidance and compliance procedures in relation to federal requirements for criminal history policies in relation to federal statutes, HUD regulations concerning criminal history policies, and internal control standards. What GAO Found The Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) requires public housing agencies (PHA) to conduct criminal background checks and terminate assistance for certain offenses, but some also provide discretion. Federal statutes and HUD regulations require PHAs to conduct criminal background checks on applicants to the public housing and HCV programs. PHAs must also conduct criminal background checks on individuals who have engaged in criminal activity, such as homicide or assault. HUD regulations also require PHAs to include certain offenses that are grounds for denial or termination in their policies, but give PHAs discretion on when and how to act on them. HUD officials stated that they were in the process of updating HUD's public housing and HCV program guidebooks to reflect newer criminal history policy guidance. However, the documentation HUD provided on these updates did not specifically address criminal history policies. HUD officials stated that they planned to update the guidebooks in December 2018. HUD field staff may have cause to review a PHA's criminal history policies for other reasons,",
    "gao_GAO-18-67": "Why GAO Did This Study The U.S. electric grid is primarily regulated by the federal government, and the federal government is responsible for ensuring the reliability of the grid. GAO was asked to review the potential effects of electromagnetic events on the electric grid. This report examines (1) the extent to which U.S. and Canadian electricity suppliers have identified information about the potential impacts of these events on the electric grid, and (2) steps selected U.S. and Canadian electricity suppliers have taken to protect against these events and understand how NERC has monitored these efforts. GAO reviewed relevant studies and interviewed officials from federal agencies, industry associations, and research institutions. GAO also reviewed NERC and FERC regulations and orders related to cost recovery, such as suppliers' costs for spare transmission equipment services. What GAO Found U.S. and Canadian electricity suppliers GAO contacted have identified information about the potential impacts of geomagnetic disturbance (GMD) events on the electric grid, but have less information about high-altitude electromagnetic pulse (HEMP) events. These studies have covered the general threats to the nation's electric grid from GMD but do not cover the unique aspects of individual suppliers' generation and transmission networks that could potentially make them more or less vulnerable to GMD events. In addition, these studies typically identified areas in which more research is needed regarding the GMD threat and potential mitigation measures that would inform suppliers' own assessments of the potential impact of GMD events on their unique networks. While noting the need for further research, some of these studies vary with regard to their assessment of the likelihood of long-term, widespread damage to the grid from these events. NERC has developed standards directing suppliers to study the vulnerabilities of their networks to GMD and establish procedures for dealing with those events, but it has yet to produce similar standards for EMP or HEMP due to the lack of information available to industry on the EMP threat and how it may impact the grid. According to NERC officials, while they have developed reliability standards directing suppliers to study the vulnerabilities of their networks to GMD and establish procedures for dealing with those events, it has yet to produce similar standards for EMP or HEMP due to the lack of information available to industry on the EMP threat and how it may impact the grid.

The quality of project cost estimates is of great importance since those estimates are the basis for DOD's requests for appropriations. GAO was asked to review DOD's MILCON appropriations. This report examines the active component's MILCON obligations and expended balances and the extent to which DOD's MILCON cost estimates are reliable and DOD's guidance for producing estimates fully incorporates all of the steps needed for developing reliable estimates. GAO analyzed MILCON appropriations, obligations, and disbursement data for fiscal years 2005 through 2016 and compared DOD's guidance for developing cost estimates against best practices for developing a reliable estimate. GAO also interviewed DOD officials and reviewed relevant DOD guidance. What GAO Found The active component of the Department of Defense (DOD) obligated all but about $5.1 billion and expended all but about $11 billion of its military construction (MILCON) appropriations for fiscal years 2005 through 2016. Of the $5.1 billion that remains unobligated, about $4.6 billion was unexpired and available for new obligations (i.e., from fiscal year 2013 through 2016 appropriations). Of the $5.1 billion that remains unobligated, about $4.6 billion was unexpired and available for new obligations (i.e., from fiscal year 2013 through 2016 appropriations). The active component reprogrammed about $1.6 billion in MILCON appropriations to fund shortfalls caused by emergency projects, projects that were authorized but did not receive specific appropriations, and projects needing additional funding in fiscal years 2010 through 2016. Of this amount, the Army reprogrammed about $789 million of about $14 billion in appropriated MILCON funds; the Navy, about $535 million of about $14 billion in appropriated MILCON funds; and the Air Force, about $295 million of about $7 billion in appropriated MILCON funds.

GAO was asked to review CMS's implementation of security protections for Medicare beneficiary data. This report (1) identifies the major entities that collect, store, and process Medicare beneficiary data and that connect with CMS systems and networks; (2) determines whether requirements for the protection of Medicare beneficiary data align with federal guidance; and (3) assesses the programs CMS has in place to oversee the implementation of security protections for Medicare beneficiary data. GAO analyzed CMS guidance, including its Acceptable Risk Safeguards (ARS), to determine the baseline requirements for the protection of Medicare beneficiary data that have been established by CMS. GAO also interviewed CMS officials responsible for overseeing the implementation of security controls by researchers and qualified entities. What GAO Found CMS shares Medicare beneficiary data with three major types of external entities: (1) Medicare Administrative Contractors (MAC), which process claims for Medicare beneficiaries; (2) research organizations (researchers), which use Medicare beneficiary data to assist CMS in monitoring, managing, and improving Medicare programs or the services provided to beneficiaries; and (3) qualified public or private entities that use claims data on behalf of CMS to evaluate the performance of Medicare service providers and equipment suppliers. CMS has developed requirements for implementing security controls that align with federal guidance for two of the three types of external entities that access Medicare beneficiary data. Specifically, adherence to the requirements, which CMS defined using a risk-based process, is mandatory for MACs and qualified entities. However, CMS does not consider the requirements to be applicable to researchers because they are not CMS contractors. Without providing comprehensive, risk-based requirements for implementing security controls to all external entities that have access to Medicare beneficiary data, CMS increases the risk that external entities possessing CMS data may not have applied security controls that meet CMS standards. CMS has established a program to oversee the MACs' implementation of security and privacy protections over Medicare beneficiary data, but it does not consistently track low-risk weaknesses in the CMS FISMA Controls Tracking System. MACs are subject to two types of independent annual assessments that regularly identify weaknesses in their implementation of security controls. The assessments have identified several recurring categories of weaknesses; however, the agency does not track low-",

DOD's Section 1648 report, which was submitted in July 2016, included six statutorily required elements. GAO was asked to review DOD's Section 1648 report. This report examines the extent to which DOD's Section 1648 report addressed the statutorily required elements. GAO analyzed DOD's Section 1648 report and interviewed relevant officials. What GAO Found The Department of Defense's (DOD) Section 1648 report addressed some, but not all, six statutorily required elements. DOD did not develop a comprehensive plan; instead, the department submitted a collection of separate documents that addressed some, but not all six statutorily required elements (hereafter referred to as DOD's Section 1648 report). DOD officials agreed that their submission was not a comprehensive plan. These officials told GAO they developed a report that they believed would address the required elements of the legislation and articulate the department's comprehensive work to prepare for supporting civil authorities in response to a cyber incident with plans, policies, guidance, among other things. Specifically, DOD's Section 1648 report is a collection of separate documents that, according to DOD, outline core federal, state, local, and private sector roles and responsibilities; summarize plans for coordination at all levels of government and across sectors in the event of a cyber incident; and prescribe the roles and responsibilities of the active and reserve components. DOD's Section 1648 report partially addressed three of the six statutorily required elements\u2014to provide (1) descriptions of the roles, responsibilities, and expectations of the active and reserve components of the armed forces; (2) the department's plans for coordination with heads of other federal agencies and state and local governments; and (3) a list of exercises previously conducted that are used in the formulation of the plan. However, key DOD documents such as DOD Directive 3025.18, DOD's Section 1648 report, and the Directive Type Memorandum issued in June 2017 do not clarify roles and responsibilities of DOD components, liaisons, and personnel who DOD had previously assigned coordination roles and responsibilities for supporting civil authorities. As a result, there is still uncertainty about these roles and responsibilities within the department. Until DOD clarifies the roles",

The NDAA 2016 directed the MHS to align its quality measures for direct and purchased care. GAO was asked to review the MHS's quality measures. This report examines the extent to which the MHS (1) uses a common set of quality measures for direct and purchased care, and (2) has established performance standards and related corrective action requirements for individual providers in direct and purchased care. GAO reviewed DOD documents and interviewed officials from DOD, the MHS, and the private health insurers that administer the MHS's networks of civilian providers for purchased care. What GAO Found The Department of Defense's (DOD) Military Health Service (MHS) does not use a common set of quality measures on its Core and Purchased Care Dashboards to assess the quality of care provided through direct and purchased care. The MHS uses 43 measures on its Core Dashboard and 18 measures on its Purchased Care Dashboard to assess the quality of care delivered in direct care and 18 measures on its Purchased Care Dashboard. The MHS uses these measures to assess the quality of care delivered in direct care only, and it does not use a common set of measures for purchased care. For both direct and purchased care, the MHS uses measures on its Dashboards that assess a more limited range of quality areas and medical conditions as compared to the widely used quality measure sets adopted by Medicare and private health insurers. Without using a broader range of available quality measures available\u2014measures that many purchased care providers already report to CMS and private health insurers\u2014DOD is missing an opportunity to better target the most critical quality of care issues in the MHS. The MHS has established performance standards in direct care related to the Core Dashboard measures and has corrective action requirements for MTFs that do not meet the standards. However, the MHS has not established performance standards related to the Purchased Care Dashboard measures for individual civilian providers in purchased care and therefore does not have related corrective action requirements for these providers. The MHS has established performance standards in direct care related to the Core Dashboard measures and has corrective action requirements for MTFs that do not meet the standards.

    "gao_GAO-19-4": "Why GAO Did This Study DOD spends about $25 billion annually to operate and support its installations, and GAO's analysis shows that IGSAs have provided opportunities for the military services to reduce some of those costs. However, the services could improve the visibility they have over the performance of IGSAs after implementation. GAO was asked to review the military services' use of IGSAs. This report examines (1) the extent to which the military services have realized financial and nonfinancial benefits from IGSAs, and (2) the extent to which the military services have supported IGSA use. GAO analyzed a sample of 8 IGSAs, reviewed relevant laws and guidance, and interviewed officials from the military services and the local government. What GAO Found The military services have realized financial and nonfinancial benefits from intergovernmental support agreements (IGSA), which are agreements between the military services and the state or local government to obtain installation services. GAO's analysis of a sample of 8 IGSAs, and interviews with officials about these and other IGSAs, found that the military services have realized financial and nonfinancial benefits from these agreements. For example, GAO found that the actual cost of each IGSA during its first year of implementation was lower than the expected cost of obtaining the installation service through an alternative contract, as shown in the respective business case analysis for each IGSA. In addition, GAO found that the estimated cost savings realized by these IGSAs totaled about $2.4 million during the first year of implementation. For example, Fort Polk, Oklahoma, realized an estimated $1.9 million in cost savings by implementing an IGSA for waste removal with its local government. Similarly, Moody Air Force Base, North Carolina, realized an estimated $270,000 in savings by implementing an IGSA for water and wastewater treatment. In addition, installation officials cited examples of IGSAs that led to enhanced mission effectiveness and readiness, reduced administrative time, and greater flexibility. The military services generally are not monitoring whether all of their IGSAs are bringing financial and nonfinancial benefits because they have not established formal processes to obtain this information and documented them in their policies or procedures, as called for in Standards for Internal Control in the Federal Government. Specifically, the Army, Navy, and Marine Corps IGSA policies do not include processes for monitoring",
    "gao_GAO-18-75": "Why GAO Did This Study DOD is developing a next-generation aircraft, known as the F-35, to replace or complement legacy aircraft. The F-35 is DOD's most expensive aircraft, and it is expected to cost more than $1.5 billion over the next 20 years. DOD is relying on a prime contractor to provide sustainment support for the F-35. GAO was asked to review DOD's F-35 sustainment program. This report examines (1) the status of DOD's efforts to sustain the F-35 fleet and any challenges it has faced, and (2) the extent to which DOD is positioned to enter into multi-year, performance-based sustainment contracts with the prime contractor by 2020. GAO reviewed DOD sustainment plans, guidance, and program documentation; analyzed aircraft performance data; and interviewed cognizant officials. What GAO Found The Department of Defense (DOD) has currently fielded and is sustaining more than 250 F-35 aircraft, and the number is expected to triple by the end of 2021 and keep growing as the program moves into full-rate production. However, DOD is facing several key sustainment challenges that pose risks to its ability to meet current and future warfighter readiness requirements, and these could limit the ability of the military services to fully leverage the capabilities of the aircraft. For example, DOD does not have enough capacity to repair F-35 aircraft parts because the establishment of repair capabilities at the military depots is 6 years behind schedule. DOD is also experiencing shortages of spare parts in the F-35 supply chain, resulting in lower than expected readiness. DOD has not fully defined all of the technical data it needs from the prime contractor to maximize the potential for future competition of contracts among providers for sustainment requirements, nor does it know the associated costs of these data. In 2014, GAO recommended that DOD develop a long-term Intellectual Property Strategy to identify all critical technical data needs and their associated costs. As of September 2017, DOD has taken some steps to develop an Intellectual Property Strategy, but it has not identified all critical needs and their associated costs. DOD is also facing delays in required software development, which is critical to sustainment. DOD is also testing performance-based agreements with the prime contractor, but it may not be well positioned to enter into multi-year, performance-based contracts by 2020. DOD is conducting pilot-",
    "gao_GAO-18-219": "Why GAO Did This Study The U.S. government engages with the governments of other countries in the Western Hemisphere through various inter-American organizations, including the Organization of American States (OAS), the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO), and the Inter-American Institute for Cooperation on Agriculture (IICA). The United States provides voluntary contributions to these organizations through assistance agreements. GAO was asked to review the use of these organizations. This report (1) assesses the extent to which the organizations' strategic goals align with those of U.S. agencies; (2) examines how the organizations oversee the use of their funds and the extent to which U.S. agencies have supported those efforts; (3) assesses the extent to which U.S. agencies included key monitoring provisions as part of their assistance agreements; and (4) assesses the extent to which U.S. agencies had documentation of monitoring activities, including those called for by these provisions. GAO analyzed agency guidance and documents, interviewed agency officials, and reviewed 12 selected assistance agreements that the four U.S. agencies awarded to OAS, PAHO, and IICA that were active during calendar years 2014 through 2016, and found that two agencies did not consistently include all key monitoring provisions in their agreements. For the 12 agreements, the agencies identified the applicable agency guidance for monitoring activities, such as financial and progress reports, and identified key monitoring provisions, such as those called for by applicable agency guidance. GAO also reviewed 12 selected assistance agreements and guidance, and interviewed agency officials. What GAO Found The strategic goals of the four inter-American organizations are predominantly aligned with the high-level strategic goals for the Western Hemisphere documented by the Departments of State (State), Health and Human Services (HHS), and Agriculture (USDA). According to officials, the agencies all consider U.S. strategic goals when deciding which projects to fund at OAS, PAHO, and IICA. The four organizations have established mechanisms for overseeing their use of assessed and voluntary contributions, such as external auditors and internal audit boards as required by the International Organization for Internal Auditors (IIA). The agencies have directly supported these mechanisms. For example, State plays a significant role in promoting policies on oversight and accountability at the four organizations through formal engagement in deliberations and decision-making of each organization's governing body and through informal engagement with other member states and the secretariat.

    "gao_GAO-19-87": "Why GAO Did This Study Tribal governments are recognized as distinct, independent political communities that are part of the unique political structure of layered sovereigns and internal governments that comprise the U.S. system of government. Tribal governments have many of the same responsibilities as state and local governments. However, tribes are generally unable to establish a strong tax base structured around the property taxes and income taxes typically available to state and local governments. Therefore, some tribes rely on a combination of federal funds and economic development initiatives as fundamental sources of financial support for the government programs and services provided to their communities. GAO was asked to review tribes' use of self-determination contracts, self-governance compacts, and the HEARTH Act. This report examines (1) factors that can affect a tribe's use of self-determination contracts, self-governance compacts, and the HEARTH Act, and (2) factors that can affect a tribe's decision to use self-determination contracts, self-governance compacts, and the HEARTH Act. GAO reviewed relevant laws and regulations, and interviewed officials from Interior, the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA), and other federal agencies. What GAO Found Several factors, including federal agencies' processes and actions, can affect tribes' use of mechanisms that further tribal self-government, such as self-determination contracts, self-governance compacts, or leasing authority under the Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act of 1975 (ISDEAA), as well as tribes' experience with these mechanisms. Some of these factors, such as federal training and resources, can help tribes develop the tribal capacity needed to take over administration of federal programs and thereby facilitate tribes' use of these mechanisms. In contrast, other factors, specifically federal processes and actions, can hinder or delay tribes' use of these mechanisms. Some of these processes include: (1) BIA's approach for sharing information with tribes seeking to develop a program using a self-determination contract, (2) Interior's process to disburse funds to tribes associated with self-determination contracts and self-governance compacts, and (3) Interior's process to review proposed tribal leasing regulations submitted under the HEARTH Act.

    "gao_GAO-18-415": "Why GAO Did This Study The United States entered into a compact of free association with the Federated States of Micronesia (FSM) and the Republic of the Marshall Islands (RMI) in 1986. The compact provided a framework for the United States and the two countries to work toward achieving economic development and self-sufficiency. The amended compacts' implementing legislation authorized and appropriated direct financial assistance to the FSM and RMI in fiscal years 2004 through 2023, with the base amounts decreasing in most years. The annual decrements in assistance are added to the amounts deposited in the trust funds established under the amended compacts for the two nations. Earnings from the compact trust funds are intended to provide an annual source of revenue after the scheduled end of compact sector grants at the end of fiscal year 2023. GAO was asked to review issues related to the FSM and RMI transition from compact grant assistance to relying on income from the compact trust funds. This report examines (1) the use and role of federal funds and programs in the FSM and RMI budgets, (2) projected compact trust fund disbursements and potential strategies to address risks to those disbursements, and (3) FSM and RMI efforts to prepare for the scheduled decrements in compact grant funding and the transition to relying on compact trust fund income. GAO analyzed U.S. law, the amended compacts' implementing legislation, and the trust fund agreements with each country. GAO also interviewed U.S., FSM, and RMI officials. What GAO Found The FSM and RMI continue to rely on U.S. grants and programs that end in 2023. Compact sector grants and the SEG, each of which end in 2023, continue to support a substantial portion of government expenditures in the FSM and RMI. In the FSM, compact sector grants and the SEG support about one-third of all government expenditures. In the RMI, compact sector grants and the SEG support about one-quarter of all government expenditures. The end of the programs and services agreements in 2024 would also require the FSM and RMI to bear additional costs to provide services currently provided by the United States as part of the agreements. GAO's updated projections for the FSM and RMI compact trust funds show similar outlooks. Several potential strategies could improve the trust funds",

In 2014, GAO reported that Border Patrol had made progress deploying technologies and had completed deployments for two technology programs in Arizona\u2014the Agent Portable Surveillance System and the Thermal Imaging Device technologies. GAO was asked to review Border Patrol's efforts to deploy surveillance technologies along the southwest border. This report examines (1) the extent to which Border Patrol has deployed surveillance technologies along the southwest border and developed guidance for future deployments, and (2) the extent to which Border Patrol has identified performance metrics for its surveillance technologies and has taken actions to improve data quality. GAO reviewed Border Patrol's Southwest Border Technology Plan and other documents, and interviewed officials from DHS, CBP, and the Department of Homeland Security (DHS). What GAO Found The U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) has completed deployments of surveillance technologies along the southwest border, and is still developing guidance for future deployments. As of October 2017, Border Patrol had initiated or completed deployments of select technologies to Arizona, Texas, California, and New Mexico. In 2014, GAO reported that Border Patrol had made progress deploying technologies and had completed deployments for two technology programs in Arizona\u2014the Agent Portable Surveillance System and the Thermal Imaging Device technologies. Since then, Border Patrol has completed deployments of several additional technology programs, including the Remote Surveillance System (RSS), Mobile Surveillance System (MSC), and Unattended Ground Sensors (UGS). Border Patrol also has efforts underway for completing deployments of other technology programs, but some of those programs have not yet begun deployment or are not yet under contract. For example, as of October 2017, Border Patrol had not yet initiated deployments of RVSS to Texas because, according to program officials, the program had only recently completed contract negotiations for procuring those systems. Border Patrol has revised schedules and cost estimates for its three highest-cost programs\u2014IFT, RVSS, and MSC\u2014and as of October 2017, is on track to meet those revised schedules and estimates; however, risks remain in Border Patrol's deployment efforts.

FNS is responsible for administering the program and overseeing state agencies that administer the program. GAO was asked to review the SFSP. This report examines (1) what is known about participation in the SFSP and how has it changed in the last 10 years? (2) what other programs help feed low-income children over the summer? and (3) what challenges exist, if any, in providing summer meals to children, and to what extent does FNS provide assistance to states and sponsors to address these challenges? GAO analyzed FNS data on meals served and days of operation from fiscal years 2007 through 2016, and interviewed officials from FNS, state agencies, and national organizations involved in summer meals. GAO also conducted site visits in three states selected based on a high proportion of children in poverty, a mix of urban and rural locations, and a mix of sponsor and site type and diverse locations. What GAO Found The total number of Summer Food Service Program (SFSP) meals served nationwide during the summer\u2014one indicator of program participation\u2014increased from 113 million meals in fiscal year 2007 to 149 million meals in fiscal year 2016, or by 32 percent, according to GAO's analysis of FNS data. The number of SFSP meals served has generally increased from year to year over this 10-year period. Most recently, meals decreased by 6 percent from 156 million meals in summer 2015 to 149 million meals in summer 2016, according to GAO's analysis of FNS data. Factors that may have affected year-to-year fluctuations include changes in funding for summer programs, sponsor participation, weather, and the number of weekdays available for sites to serve meals within a given summer. According to GAO's analysis of FNS data, SFSP lunches served in the summer months increased by over 17 million from fiscal year 2007 through fiscal year 2016, accounting for almost half of the total increase in the number of SFSP meals served in that period. However, when comparing across each of the meal types, supper and breakfast had the largest percentage increases over the 10-year period, 50 and 48 percent, respectively.

NSF uses IPA rotators in executive and program director positions and VSEE rotators in program director positions. GAO was asked to review NSF's use of rotators. This report examines (1) the number and cost of rotators at NSF and their use in executive and program director positions, (2) the extent to which NSF has adopted cost-management strategies to manage IPA rotators' costs, and (3) the extent to which NSF has developed an agency-wide workforce strategy for using rotators. GAO reviewed NSF documents and interviewed NSF officials. GAO also reviewed NSF's workforce strategy and interviewed federal and rotator staff in executive and program director positions. What GAO Found The National Science Foundation (NSF) maintained a relatively stable number and cost of rotators and used them in executive and program director positions at NSF. Most rotators were IPA rotators, and the proportion of rotators relative to other staff has remained relatively stable over time. During the 10-year period GAO reviewed, from fiscal year 2008 through fiscal year 2017, IPA and VSEE rotators comprised about 12 percent and about 3 percent, respectively, of NSF's total workforce; and the number of IPA rotators ranged from 162 to 190 (about 11 to 12 percent of total staff), and the number of VSEE rotators ranged from 22 to 52 (about 1 to 3 percent of total staff). NSF used IPA rotators in executive and program director positions and VSEE rotators in program director positions. NSF used rotators in these positions alongside its permanent staff to perform day-to-day agency operations, including managing the agency's merit review process for determining which projects to fund. NSF adopted rotator program cost-management strategies expected to achieve the greatest savings with the least harm to recruitment, but NSF officials said it is too soon to determine the full results because these new strategies are being phased in for new IPA agreements only.

The Next Generation 911 Advancement Act of 2012 included a provision for GAO to review the NG911 transition. This report examines (1) progress states and localities are making to implement NG911 and the challenges they have faced and (2) how federal agencies have addressed state and local implementation challenges and planned next steps. GAO analyzed state-reported NG911 progress data from the 2016 National 911 Progress Report and the Eighth Annual Report to Congress on State Collection and Distribution of 911 and Enhanced 911 Fees and Charges, and interviewed federal officials and 911 stakeholders in nine states selected based on a variety of factors, including a non-generalizable sample of 10 states. What GAO Found According to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration's (NHTSA) most recent national survey, state and local progress implementing Next Generation 911 (NG911) varies, and about half of all states reported being in some phase of transition to NG911 in 2015. While a few states are well into statewide implementation, NHTSA officials told GAO that no state had completely implemented all NG911 functions. Additionally, as of the fall of 2017, none of the selected states GAO spoke with were processing multimedia\u2014such as images or audio/video recordings\u2014through their 911 systems due to concerns related to privacy, liability, and the ability to store and manage these types of data, among other things. Federal officials, industry stakeholders, and state and local 911 officials GAO interviewed from nine states identified a number of challenges to implementing NG911, including challenges related to funding, evolving technology and operations, and governance. Funding: State and local officials in four of nine selected states identified insufficient funding as one of the challenges they face in implementing NG911. Additionally, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), and industry reports noted that state and local financing strategies are generally insufficient to fully implement NG911.

FNS administers SNAP E&T programs, which provide services to participants, such as job search assistance. The Agricultural Act of 2014 included a provision for GAO to review SNAP E&T programs. This report examines (1) what is known about SNAP E&T program participants and outcomes over time and (2) the extent to which state SNAP E&T programs have partnered with other programs offering similar services. GAO analyzed FNS data on SNAP E&T participants and outcomes from fiscal years 2008 through 2016, the most recent available; reviewed relevant federal laws, regulations, and guidance; and interviewed FNS and state officials. What GAO Found The Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) employment and training (E&T) programs have served a small and decreasing percentage of overall SNAP recipients over time, and although these data are generally reliable, FNS data on SNAP E&T program participant characteristics and outcomes are not reliable. According to FNS data, in an average month of fiscal year 2016, about 0.5 percent of SNAP recipients\u2014about 200,000\u2014were served by state SNAP E&T programs. FNS data also show that the percentage of SNAP recipients participating in SNAP E&T programs decreased from about 0.9 percent to about 0.5 percent, and the percentage of work registrants participating in these programs decreased from about 8.1 percent to about 3.4 percent. FNS officials said that states may move to voluntary programs, such as voluntary programs, to increase participation among SNAP recipients who are referred to the program. FNS officials said that states could benefit from technical assistance on increasing the rates at which SNAP recipients participate in SNAP E&T activities, but the agency's SNAP E&T technical assistance resources have generally not focused on this issue. FNS officials also said that states could benefit from technical assistance on increasing the rates at which SNAP recipients participate in SNAP E&T activities, but the agency's SNAP E&T technical assistance resources have generally not focused on this issue. FNS officials said that they believe states could take steps to make enrolling and participating in SNAP E&T activities less burdensome for SNAP recipients.

    "gao_GAO-18-456": "Why GAO Did This Study NNSA and DOD are managing four ongoing LEPs to consolidate the nuclear bomb stockpile into fewer weapon types. The B61-12 LEP is to be completed in fiscal year 2025, with a first production unit date of March 2020. GAO was asked to review the B61-12 LEP. This report examines (1) the extent to which NNSA and DOD have incorporated best practices in developing the B61-12 LEP cost estimate, (2) the extent to which NNSA and DOD have identified and are managing risks within the program, and (3) the extent to which NNSA and DOD have identified and are managing risks within the program's responsibility. GAO analyzed program documents and interviewed program officials. What GAO Found The National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA) substantially incorporated most of the cost estimating best practices identified by GAO's past work when it developed the $7.6 billion program cost estimate for the B61-12 life extension program (LEP). GAO's cost estimating guide identifies four characteristics of such an estimate: it is comprehensive, well-documented, accurate, and credible. The program substantially met the criteria for a comprehensive cost estimate, which GAO believes contributed to the program's estimate being reliable. The program used different methods and assumptions about future program performance, which led to differences between the estimates. For example, the program estimated that the program would cost $7.6 billion and that the LEP would be completed in fiscal year 2025, with a first production unit date of March 2020. However, NNSA did not document the rationale for its decision to use the program office's lower estimate unchanged or a plan for how it would take the independent cost estimate into consideration. GAO recommended in a January 2018 report that NNSA should document and justify key decisions based on a reconciliation of LEP cost estimates with the Office of Cost Estimating and Program Evaluation's independent cost estimates. NNSA agreed with this recommendation. The program also used different methods and assumptions about future program performance, which led to differences between the estimates. For example, the program estimated that the program would cost approximately $10.0 billion and take about 2 years longer than the independent cost estimate. However, NNSA did not document the rationale for its decision to use the program office's lower estimate unchanged or a plan for how it would take the independent cost estimate into consideration.",
    "gao_GAO-18-589": "Why GAO Did This Study The Bureau relies on a complete and accurate address list to maximize the cost-efficient self-response rate. The Bureau uses a schedule to forecast the effects of delayed, deleted, and added effort, as well as possible avenues for time and cost recovery. GAO has previously reported that a reliable schedule can provide a road map for systematic execution of a program, and the means by which to gauge progress, identify and address potential problems, and promote accountability. GAO was asked to review the Bureau's 2020 Census schedule. This report assesses the extent to which the Bureau is using leading practices for scheduling key projects. GAO selected three projects from the Bureau's 2020 Census integrated master schedule, focusing on the cost of the projects, their significance to the 2020 Census, and the fact that they were in progress. GAO reviewed the Bureau's schedules and underlying sub-schedules to assess them against leading practices. GAO also interviewed Bureau officials responsible for the 2020 schedule. What GAO Found The U.S. Census Bureau's (Bureau) 2020 Census project schedules better reflected the characteristics of a reliable schedule compared to its 2013 assessment of the Bureau's schedule. For example, the three projects GAO assessed better reflected two of the four characteristics of a reliable schedule compared to its 2013 assessment. For example, the projects GAO assessed reflect the work to be accomplished for the project schedules, and each project schedule includes estimates of the duration of each activity. However, the Bureau has not fully met the characteristics of a comprehensive schedule. For example, the Bureau's 2020 Census Operational Plan requires each project to have a schedule work breakdown structure dictionary, which is a valuable communication tool between systems engineers, program management, and other stakeholders because it provides a clear picture of what efforts have to be accomplished. The Bureau has not created these dictionaries. The absence of such a dictionary could potentially lead to confusion among staff in different census offices about the scope of the work they are responsible for performing. The Bureau's 2020 Schedule Management Plan states that it is the responsibility of a representative from a project team and the schedule staff to assign resources to an individual project schedule, and that defining and assigning resources should be done following the testing phase of the 2020 Census Lifecycle. The Bureau is now in its implementation phase, so according to its",

TSA assesses the effectiveness of security measures at foreign airports, including those in Cuba offering U.S.-bound public charter and scheduled commercial flights. GAO was asked to review TSA's air carrier inspections. This report examines (1) the extent to which TSA complied with its standard operating procedures when assessing aviation security at Cuban airports in fiscal years 2012 through 2017, (2) the results of TSA's Cuban airport assessments in fiscal years 2012 through 2017, and (3) the results of TSA's air carrier inspections for Cuba in fiscal years 2016\u2014when commercial scheduled air service between the United States and Cuba resumed\u2014and 2017. GAO analyzed TSA's standard operating procedures and air carrier inspection data from fiscal years 2012 through 2016 and interviewed TSA officials and air carriers. What GAO Found The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) generally followed its standard operating procedures when assessing aviation security at Cuban airports in fiscal years 2012 through 2017, but improvements can help ensure they occur at the established frequency. During fiscal years 2012 through 2017, TSA inspectors generally followed its standard operating procedures for documenting foreign airport assessments as required by TSA's 2010 and 2016 Foreign Airport Assessment Program Standard Operating Procedures and Global Risk Analysis and Decision Support (GRADS) Business Rules. Similarly, TSA inspectors generally followed its standard operating procedures for documenting air carrier inspection results in fiscal years 2016 and 2017 as required by the PARIS Business Rules. TSA also resolved reported deficiencies in a timely manner, and conducted foreign airport assessments at established intervals as required by TSA's 2010 and 2016 procedures. GAO's analysis of TSA air carrier inspection data from fiscal years 2012 through 2016\u2014a period in which public charter flights accounted for nearly all commercial air traffic between the United States and Cuba\u2014reveals that TSA did not always inspect air carriers operating U.S.-bound flights from Cuba each fiscal year at the frequency established in its standard operating procedures. In general, public charter flights are operated by air carriers but arranged or sponsored by a charter operator. Consistent with scheduled service, TSA requires air carriers operating U.S.-bound public charters to adopt and implement a TSA-approved security program.

Possession of this material within the United States requires a license from NRC or from one of the 37 Agreement States to which NRC has relinquished regulatory responsibility. CBP has implemented a policy and procedures intended to ensure that the tens of thousands of shipments of potentially dangerous radiological material imported through U.S. airports each year are properly licensed. GAO was asked to review CBP's policies and procedures. This report examines (1) CBP's policies and procedures for identifying licensable radiological material and (2) the extent to which CBP's policies and procedures ensure that only properly licensed radiological material is imported into the United States. GAO reviewed CBP policies and procedures and interviewed CBP officials at four U.S. airports selected based on the number of shipments of potentially dangerous radiological material imported from January 1, 2015, to September 30, 2016. GAO also reviewed CBP data on license verifications and interviewed CBP officials at four airports selected based on the number of shipments of potentially dangerous radiological material imported. What GAO Found The Department of Homeland Security's (DHS) Customs and Border Protection (CBP) has implemented a policy and procedures requiring CBP officials at airports to contact experts within a centralized CBP office to verify licenses for radiological material being shipped into the United States. Specifically, CBP issued its \u201cRadiation Detection Standard Operating Procedures Directive\u201d in March 2014, outlining when CBP officials at ports of entry are required to contact internal experts at CBP's Teleforensic Center who possess the technical expertise to verify that the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) and the United States Agreement State licenses for radiological materials are legitimate. CBP's 2014 policy requires CBP personnel to verify the legitimacy of NRC and Agreement State licenses for all commercial imports of industrial and medical radionuclides that require a license from NRC or one of the 37 Agreement States. CBP officials at four airports GAO visited did not verify the legitimacy of licenses for a significant number of shipments identified by CBP as requiring license verification\u2014leaving many licenses unverified over this 21-month period. CBP officials at two of the four airports GAO visited may not have verified",

The project is estimated to cost over $1.6 billion and take over 10 years to complete. In September 2014, GAO reported that DHS and GSA had not fully implemented leading capital decision-making practices for consolidating the project. This statement discusses (1) the extent to which DHS and GSA have implemented leading capital decision-making practices for the St. Elizabeths project and (2) the extent to which DHS and GSA have implemented leading acquisition guidance when overseeing the St. Elizabeths project. This statement is based on GAO's September 2014 report, which was issued on September 16, 2014. GAO reviewed relevant DHS and GSA documents and interviewed DHS and GSA officials. What GAO Found In its September 2014 report, GAO found that the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and the General Services Administration (GSA) planning for the DHS headquarters consolidation did not fully conform with leading capital decision-making practices intended to help agencies effectively plan and procure assets. Specifically, GAO found that DHS and GSA had not conducted a comprehensive assessment of current needs, identified capability gaps, or evaluated and prioritized alternatives that would help officials adapt consolidation plans to changing conditions and address funding issues as reflected in leading practices. For example, DHS had an overall goal of reducing the square footage allotted per employee across the department in accordance with workplace standards, such as standards for telework and hoteling. DHS and GSA officials reported that they had begun to work together to consider changes to the DHS headquarters consolidation plans, but they had not announced when new plans would be issued. Furthermore, because final documentation of agency deliberations or analyses had not yet been developed, it was unclear if any new plans would be informed by an updated comprehensive needs assessment and capability gap analysis as called for by leading capital decision-making practices. Therefore, in GAO's September 2014 report, GAO recommended that DHS and GSA conduct various assessments and analyses and use the results to inform updated DHS headquarters consolidation plans. DHS and GSA concurred with this recommendation and stated that their forthcoming draft St. Elizabeths Enhanced Consolidation Plan would contain these analyses. As of April",
    "gao_GAO-19-17": "Why GAO Did This Study The Buy American Act of 1933 established a preference for the federal government to buy domestic end products. The Buy American Act does not apply to products that are purchased for use outside the United States or obtained through contracts under the micro-purchase threshold, which was generally $3,500 in fiscal year 2017. The Buy American Act also waives domestic purchasing requirements for certain acquisitions of foreign end products from countries that are party to international trade agreements or are considered designated countries by the U.S. Trade Representative. GAO was asked to review the Buy American Act. This report assesses the extent to which (1) the federal government procures foreign products through Buy American Act exceptions and waivers; and (2) selected agencies provide training and guidance to implement the Buy American Act requirements. GAO analyzed federal procurement data from FPDS-NG for fiscal year 2017, which is the most recent and complete data available at the time of GAO's review. GAO also reviewed guidance and training available at selected agencies. What GAO Found In fiscal year 2017, the federal government obligated approximately $7.8 billion for the acquisition of foreign end products, which accounts for less than 5 percent of total federal contract obligations for end products in that year. Foreign end products accounted for approximately 3 to 8 percent of goods subject to Buy American Act restrictions between fiscal years 2013 through 2016. The federal government also procured foreign end products through means separate from the exceptions allowed under the Buy American Act, primarily in cases where the Act would not apply. For fiscal year 2017, the federal government obligated approximately $700 million to procure foreign end products by applying one of five government-wide Buy American Act exceptions\u2014such as domestic non-availability or unreasonable cost\u2014in the Federal Procurement Data System-Next Generation (FPDS-NG), which is the government-wide database for contract awards and obligations. However, GAO found that agencies may not always input reliable information on the extent to which exceptions or waivers authorized the acquisition of foreign end products. For example, in three of the six contracts GAO reviewed, agencies recorded the wrong exception or waiver, most often because of an error when reporting the place of manufacture in FPDS-NG. In the remaining contracts, agencies misreported whether an end product came from the United States or another country. GAO further identified system limitations in how FPDS-NG captures information. For example, DOD does not have an option",

However, prior IT expenditures have often resulted in significant cost overruns, schedule delays, and questionable mission-related achievements. GAO was asked to review OMB's oversight of federal IT programs. This report examines the extent to which OMB (1) identified and reported on the top 10 high priority IT programs and (2) identified and reported on the status of USDS's projects. GAO reviewed OMB documents and interviewed OMB and agency officials. GAO also reviewed OMB reports to Congress on the top 10 high priority programs and USDS projects. What GAO Found The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) reported that it undertook a structured approach to identifying the top 10 high priority IT programs it reported to Congress in June 2015 and June 2016. Specifically, staff in the Office of the Federal Chief Information Officer's (Federal CIO) E-Gov office, including the Unit Chief for the Agency Oversight and Implementation team, stated that they chose the top 10 programs from a list of high impact programs that OMB separately maintains. They added that their approach was not guided by any documented procedures or scoring techniques to distinguish the programs. OMB subsequently issued two reports to Congress\u2014in June 2015 and June 2016\u2014that identified the top 10 high priority programs. Along with the status of each program, the reports identified the IT investments that were a part of each program as well as total IT spending, average CIO risk rating, major milestones, and the level of involvement the U.S. Department of State (USDS) has with the program. OMB subsequently issued two reports to Congress\u2014in June 2015 and June 2016\u2014that identified the top 10 high priority programs.

Any disruption to the system would have severe economic and military consequences. In keeping the system sustained and modernized with additional capabilities, DOD has spent billions of dollars more than planned developing five interdependent GPS programs. GAO was asked to review GPS acquisition risks. This report examines (1) the extent to which there are acquisition risks to sustaining the GPS constellation and (2) the extent to which DOD faces acquisition challenges developing a new ground system to control the broadcast of a modernized GPS signal. GAO reviewed program plans, test plans, and other documents and interviewed officials from the GPS programs, the Air Force, and the Defense Contract Management Agency. What GAO Found The Global Positioning System (GPS) is a national asset for civilians and the military service members who depend upon it each day. The current GPS constellation is now projected to meet its availability performance standard (in the absence of operational GPS III satellites) into June 2021\u2014an increase of nearly 2 years over previous projections. This increase will give the Air Force more schedule buffer in the event of any additional delays to the GPS III satellite program. However, the Air Force still faces technical risks and schedule pressures in both the short and long term. In the short term, schedule compression with the first GPS III satellite is placing the satellite's launch and operation at risk of further delays. In the long term, most of the satellites under contract will have been launched before operational testing is completed, limiting Air Force corrective options if issues are discovered. DOD has established high-risk schedules for modernizing the GPS broadcast, or M-code signal, produced by GPS satellites. These risks are manifest in different ways. In the near term, the Air Force plans to provide a limited M-code broadcast\u2014one that does not have all of the capabilities of OCX\u2014in the MGUE program in fiscal year 2020. However, the MCEU schedule is high risk for its dependency on the timely completion of the Air Force's Contingency Operations (COps) program, for its aggressive schedule, and because of competition for limited test resources. Further, the full M-code broadcast capability, planned for fiscal year 2022, is at high risk of additional delays because (1) it is dependent on unproven efficiencies in software coding, (2) the program",

GAO was asked to review DHS R&D efforts. This report examines (1) the extent to which DHS has conducted R&D that aligns with mission areas across DHS, and (2) the extent to which DHS has developed and implemented policies and guidance for defining, reporting, and coordinating R&D activities across DHS. GAO analyzed DHS R&D obligations data for fiscal years 2010 through 2017, and interviewed DHS officials. What GAO Found The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Science and Technology Directorate (S&T) conducts research and development (R&D) that aligns with mission areas across seven DHS components. S&T has obligated more than $10 billion annually for R&D that aligns with mission areas across seven DHS components. S&T has implemented two mechanisms to coordinate R&D efforts across DHS: (1) a central mechanism to coordinate R&D efforts across DHS, and (2) a central mechanism to coordinate R&D efforts across DHS. S&T officials reported that the IPT process has helped enhance collaboration and improved visibility into R&D efforts across DHS. However, challenges remain in ensuring that components fully participate in the IPT process. For example, DHS's Chemical Weapons Management Directorate (CWMD), which has the second-largest R&D budget within DHS, does not participate in the IPT process because it has its own internal process for identifying and prioritizing capability gaps. DHS has taken steps to identify and track information related to ongoing R&D projects across DHS, and in 2017, DHS developed a common appropriations structure that standardized R&D budgeting processes across the department. However, S&T's efforts to identify and track R&D project information have limitations and can result in information that is not comprehensive. For example, in response to a 2015 request from the Secretary of Homeland Security that the IPTs identify R&D work being performed across DHS, S&T issued a \u201cReport of Coordinated R&D\u201d in 2016 and 2017.

EXIM's underwriting policies and procedures are documented in EXIM's Loan, Guarantee, and Insurance Manual (Manual), which consists of 26 chapters covering various topics by product (e.g., long-term loans and loan guarantees) or process (e.g., application intake or credit structure). GAO was asked to review EXIM's underwriting policies and procedures. This report assesses the extent to which EXIM's (1) process for updating its underwriting policies and procedures is properly designed and implemented and (2) underwriting policies and procedures for loan and loan guarantee transactions are consistent with guidance for managing federal credit programs. GAO reviewed EXIM's policies and procedures for updating its Loan, Guarantee, and Insurance Manual and interviewed EXIM officials. What GAO Found The Export-Import Bank's (EXIM) (1) process for updating its underwriting policies and procedures is properly designed and implemented and (2) underwriting policies and procedures for loan and loan guarantee transactions are consistent with guidance for managing federal credit programs. EXIM's Manual describes EXIM's underwriting policies and procedures for each of its products offered, including short-, medium-, and long-term loans and loan guarantees. EXIM's underwriting process calls for thorough credit assessments by subject matter experts and loan officers. These assessments evaluate key transactional risks, such as the borrower's industry, competitive position, operating performance, liquidity position, leverage, and ability to service debt obligations. EXIM's underwriting process also serves as EXIM's primary method for preventing fraud because of the due diligence performed on the proposed transaction.

NIST's efforts help ensure U.S. industry's ability to develop and use standards to enhance the economic and technological competitiveness of the United States. GAO was asked to review NIST's efforts to develop and use standards. This report examines (1) challenges NIST faces in providing measurement services and supporting documentary standards development, and (2) steps NIST has taken to address these challenges. GAO reviewed relevant literature and interviewed NIST officials and stakeholders, including industry and government officials, standards executives, and others. GAO also conducted five focus groups with stakeholders from five different industries and five different government agencies. What GAO Found The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) faces challenges in providing measurement services and supporting documentary standards development, based on GAO's literature review, NIST stakeholder focus groups, and interviews with stakeholders and agency officials. First, the breadth of U.S. industry and the number of stakeholder development organizations (SDO) make it challenging to identify and prioritize among these needs. Second, ensuring adequate U.S. representation in international standards activities can be challenging due to the number of activities and other factors. Third, the involvement of multiple federal agencies and interdisciplinary issues makes coordinating among federal agencies on documentary standards challenging. NIST works to address the challenges it faces in providing measurement services and supporting documentary standards development in a variety of ways, but opportunities exist to improve some efforts. First, NIST's efforts help address challenges to identifying and prioritizing measurement-service and documentary-standards needs, but some efforts do not fully align with federal guidance or NIST policy. Second, NIST's efforts help support U.S. representation in international standards organizations but may not fully implement its role and address the challenge it faces. Third, NIST's efforts support federal agency coordination on standards issues but do not fully align with selected leading collaboration practices. For example, NIST has not updated its charter to reflect recent changes in documentary standards. Without a mechanism to identify and respond to circumstances when U.S. representation may be inadequate, NIST may miss opportunities to take action in furtherance of its mission to support U.S. competitiveness by helping to ensure adequate U.S. representation in international standards activities.",

In 2012, DOE's contractor began implementing quality assurance measures to ensure that WTP work did not result in new or recurring quality assurance problems. GAO was asked to review DOE's quality assurance program. This report examines (1) actions DOE has taken to identify and address quality assurance problems at the WTP and (2) DOE's oversight of the contractor's quality assurance program. GAO reviewed DOE documents and interviewed DOE officials and quality assurance experts. What GAO Found The Department of Energy's (DOE) Office of the Secretary of Energy's (DOE) Office of the Reclamation for the Waste Treatment and Immobilization Plant (WTP) has taken several actions to identify and address quality assurance problems at the WTP, but all planned actions have not been completed. In 2013, DOE conducted a comprehensive audit, which resulted in several actions, including when the office had the contractor begin implementing a Managed Improvement Plan (MIP) in 2014. The MIP is intended to ensure that the WTP could operate in compliance with DOE-approved safety and quality requirements. Implementation of the MIP was to be completed by April 2016. Although the contractor reported that the implementation was complete, some of the plan's corrective measures have not been fully implemented, according to contractor documents and quality assurance experts GAO spoke to. In addition, ORP's effort to verify the extent to which the contractor has implemented MIP corrective measures is not scheduled to be complete until at least December 2018.

In fiscal year 2015, VA obligated about $10.1 billion to purchase care from non-VA providers. In 2005, Congress enacted a round of closures and realignments of military installations to reduce excess infrastructure and produce savings. This testimony discusses (1) VA's efforts to align its facilities and services and (2) key elements and challenges affecting DOD and the BRAC Commission in 2005. This statement is based on GAO's April 2017 report, VA Integrated Planning: Limitations in VA's Capital Planning Process Impede its Alignment of Facilities (GAO-17-23). GAO reviewed relevant laws, regulations, and guidance; interviewed officials from DOD, the military services, and the BRAC Commission; and reviewed relevant documents and interviewed officials from the military services and the BRAC Commission. What GAO Found Geographic shifts in the veterans' population, changes in health care delivery, an aging infrastructure, and limited stakeholder involvement affect VA's efforts to align its services and real property portfolio to meet the needs of veterans. For example, there has been a shift over time from inpatient to outpatient care. This shift will likely result in underutilized space once used for inpatient care. In such instances, it is often difficult and costly for VA to modernize, renovate, and retrofit these older facilities. In June 2017, VA reported that its facility inventory includes 430 vacant or mostly vacant buildings that are, on average, more than 60 years old, and an additional 784 buildings that are underutilized. The historic status of some VA facilities adds to the complexity of converting or disposing of them. In some instances, it may be more expensive to renovate than to demolish and rebuild outdated facilities. In other cases, however, there may not be an option to demolish if these buildings are designated as historic. VA has also encountered challenges to its facility alignment efforts, in part, because it has not consistently followed best practices for effectively engaging stakeholders. VA may align its facilities to meet veterans' needs by expanding or consolidating facilities or services.

In March 2018, GAO reported that VA could help ensure successful implementation of appeals reform by addressing gaps in its planning. This testimony discusses VA's progress in implementing GAO's recommendations. This statement is based on GAO's March 2018 report, Veterans Appeals Improvement and Modernization: VA Needs to Address Gaps in Planning, but Has Not Fully Addressed GAO's Recommendations (GAO-2018-02-28). GAO reviewed VA's appeals plan and interviewed VA officials. What GAO Found In its March 2018 report, GAO found that the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) could help ensure successful implementation of appeals reform by addressing gaps in its planning. GAO recommended four actions that VA should take: (1) address all legally required elements required by the Veterans Appeals Improvement and Modernization Act of 2017, (2) articulate how it will monitor and assess the performance of the new appeals process compared to the legacy process, (3) augment its master schedule to manage the project, and (4) address risk more fully. VA has taken steps in response to all four, but has not fully addressed GAO's recommendations. VA's November 2017 plan for implementing a new disability appeals process while attending to appeals under way in the current (legacy) process, addressed most, but not all, elements required by the Veterans Appeals Improvement and Modernization Act of 2017. Specifically, GAO found that VA's appeals plan addressed 17 of 22 elements required by the Act. For the five remaining elements, it partially addressed 4 elements related to monitoring implementation, projecting productivity, and workforce planning, and did not address 1 element related to identifying total resources. VA's updated plan, however, continues to only partially address 3 elements related to monitoring implementation and workforce planning, and now addresses the 1 element related to delineating the total resources required by Veterans Benefits Administration (VBA) and the Veterans Benefits Administration (Board). Until VA's appeals plan provides complete information on all required elements, Congress may not have the information needed to conduct oversight of the agency's efforts to implement and administer the new process while addressing legacy appeals. VA's May 2018 update to its appeals plan addressed some but not all",
    "gao_GAO-18-454": "Why GAO Did This Study The Coast Guard is responsible for acquiring and operating a portfolio of major acquisition programs, including aircraft, vessels, and command and control systems. GAO has previously reported on the Coast Guard's management of its acquisition portfolio and the oversight of its depot-level maintenance resources. GAO was asked to review the Coast Guard's acquisition portfolio. This report assesses (1) the extent to which the Coast Guard has made changes to how it manages its acquisition portfolio and (2) how the Coast Guard is sustaining existing assets until new assets become operational. GAO analyzed Coast Guard documents and interviewed Coast Guard officials. What GAO Found The Coast Guard's 5-year Capital Investment Plan (CIP) does not fully reflect cost realities or acquisition needs. For example, the most recent CIP\u2014from fiscal years 2018 through 2022\u2014projects funding for its portfolio of major acquisitions that, over the 5-year period, exceeds average budget requests in the last several years. As such, GAO found that the Coast Guard continues to face the same programmatic risks that annual CIP-based planning perpetuates, similar to what GAO has been reporting since 2011. To address funding constraints, the Coast Guard has been in a reactive mode by making prioritization decisions through the annual budget process without identifying how trade-off decisions made in the current budget cycle will affect the future of the acquisition portfolio. As a result of this planning process, and as GAO has reported in 2012 and in this current review, the Coast Guard has continued to defer planned acquisitions to future years and left a number of operational capability gaps unaddressed that could affect future operations. Moreover, the Coast Guard has not conducted portfolio-wide oversight through its cross-directorate groups. The Coast Guard has a management body in place to conduct oversight of its major acquisition programs; however, this management body has not conducted oversight across the entire acquisition portfolio from a collective approach. Among the Coast Guard's three cross-directorate groups, the Executive Oversight Council is positioned to oversee the portfolio collectively and has the potential to implement key portfolio-wide management practices, including conducting formal reviews and issuing reports. However, this council has not conducted these portfolio-wide reviews collectively. Instead, the council has not conducted these reviews collectively. Moreover, the Coast Guard has not conducted portfolio-wide oversight through its cross-directorate groups. Without collective portfolio",
    "gao_GAO-19-209": "Why GAO Did This Study DOD acquires new weapons for its warfighters through a management process known as the defense acquisition process. This process has multiple phases, including (1) technology maturation and risk reduction, (2) engineering and manufacturing development, and (3) production and deployment. GAO was asked to review DOD's acquisition programs. This report examines (1) factors that influence the workforce size, composition, and mix of selected DOD acquisition programs and (2) the personnel costs for selected DOD acquisition programs. GAO reviewed DOD's budget requests for fiscal years 2018 and 2019 associated with the 11 selected programs and interviewed DOD officials. What GAO Found Several interrelated factors influenced the workforce size, composition, and mix of the 11 selected major defense acquisition programs GAO reviewed. First, the program assumed responsibility for technical development and integration, as well as the program's stage within the acquisition life cycle. Second, the program workforce mix varied depending on the use of contractor personnel, which was based on the workload requirements and the availability of government personnel to provide the skills needed. Programs were generally structured as either stand-alone--new, high priority, complex weapon system platforms with dedicated personnel--or as part of a portfolio of related programs to share personnel across programs. The personnel costs for each major defense acquisition program GAO reviewed are included in different parts of the President's annual budget request, including budget justification documents, but are not always clearly identifiable due to different approaches used to report such costs. The DOD Financial Management Regulation gives the military departments flexibility in how they submit program personnel costs. For example, it suggests the use of \"typical\" personnel cost categories for research, development, test, and evaluation programs to include in their individual program budget exhibits, but it also allows the departments to use the personnel cost categories they deem to be the most appropriate when formulating the budget request. In reviewing DOD's budget requests for fiscal years 2018 and 2019, GAO found that personnel costs are budgeted for in two main wayscentrally by the military department, or by an individual programdepending on whether the requests are for military, civilian, or contractor support services. Personnel costs that are program-funded are included in individual program budget justification requests, whereas personnel costs that are centrally funded by the military departments are aggregated into one or more line items in the military department's specific appropriation request.",
    "gao_GAO-18-682": "Why GAO Did This Study The federal government has recognized 573 Indian tribes as distinct, independent political communities with inherent powers of a limited sovereignty, which has never been extinguished. However, little federal funding aimed at increasing broadband deployment actually goes to tribal entities, even though the National Broadband Plan stressed that tribes needed substantially greater financial support and recommended that federal agencies facilitate tribal access to broadband funding opportunities. GAO was asked to review broadband deployment on tribal lands. This report discusses (1) examples of partnership arrangements that tribal entities have used to increase broadband deployment on tribal lands and the outcomes of those partnerships, (2) the amount of funding provided to tribal entities for broadband deployment from key federal programs, and (3) stakeholder-identified barriers that tribal entities face in obtaining federal funding for broadband deployment and the extent to which federal agencies have taken action to address those barriers. GAO reviewed relevant federal statutes, regulations, and policy statements and interviewed officials from FCC, RUS, and NTIA. GAO also reviewed relevant federal literature and interviewed officials from seven tribes in Idaho, New Mexico, and Washington State. What GAO Found GAO identified some partnership arrangements between tribes and other entities to increase broadband deployment on tribal lands using prior authorized funding, based on GAO's review, these arrangements are not being used under currently available programs. As previously noted, there are greater costs associated with deploying broadband on unserved tribal lands because the unserved areas are generally rural, with possibly rugged terrain, and have low population densities. Because of these greater costs, there may be little to no private sector incentive to deploy broadband or enter into a partnership arrangement to do so. During GAO's review, GAO did not find any partnership arrangements that leveraged currently available federal funding from the Federal Communications Commission's (FCC) High-cost Program or the Rural Utilities Service's Community Connect Program. The seven partnership examples GAO identified were those that obtained federal funding under past programs, namely the Broadband Initiatives Program and the Broadband Technology Opportunities Program. Among these examples, tribes partnered with several different types of entities that were eligible to receive federal grants, including (1) private providers; (2) a community access network provider; (3) an electric cooperative; (4) a regional consortium; and (5) tribally owned telecommunications companies (which GAO will refer to as tribally owned providers).

For fiscal years 2008 through 2017, the President's budgets requested about $4.78 billion per year, on average, in discretionary funding for the Corps' civil works program to plan, construct, operate, and maintain a wide range of water resources projects. Of this total, the budget requested an average of about $1.39 billion total per year for construction projects in the aquatic ecosystem restoration, flood risk management, and navigation business lines. GAO was asked to review the President's budget requests for the Corps. This report examines (1) the number of construction projects and funds included in the President's budget requests for fiscal years 2008 through 2017, by state, within the Corps' three main business lines, and (2) the extent to which the Corps used a multi-level process to prioritize construction projects to recommend for inclusion in the President's budget requests for fiscal years 2008 through 2017. GAO analyzed the President's budget requests for fiscal years 2008 through 2017, reviewed relevant documents, and interviewed Corps officials. What GAO Found For fiscal years 2008 through 2017, the President's budget requests for the Corps included 164 construction projects located in 31 states, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico. The five states for which the most funds were requested in this period were: Florida, with $2.4 billion requested for 15 construction projects, Illinois, with $2.3 billion requested for 15 construction projects, California, with $1.6 billion requested for 24 construction projects, Washington, with $924 million requested for 9 construction projects, Kentucky, with $646 million requested for 6 construction projects. The projects in these five states accounted for 61 percent of the $12.9 billion that the President requested for Corps construction projects in these years. For fiscal years 2015 through 2017, the Corps provided GAO with detailed data for the construction projects included in the President's budget requests. This information included latitudinal and longitudinal coordinates to locate projects within states and divisions, as well as business-line-specific data. A total of 71 construction projects were included in the President's budget requests for these three main business lines during this period. According to Corps budget data, most of the projects were near either water sources or Corps-constructed water infrastructure. Corps headquarters officials said that the Corps does not specifically use geographic locations to select construction projects to recommend",
    "gao_GAO-19-49": "Why GAO Did This Study OMB requires federal agencies to develop policies and procedures that address a number of IT budgeting requirements. GAO was asked to review the implementation of FITARA. This report examines the extent to which selected federal agencies (1) established policies and procedures in place that address IT budgeting requirements of FITARA and related OMB guidance, (2) could demonstrate that they had developed fiscal year 2017 IT budgets for sampled investments consistent with FITARA and OMB guidance, and (3) implemented processes to ensure that annual IT budgets are informed by reliable cost information. GAO reviewed OMB and department policies and procedures, compared them to OMB and department guidance, and interviewed officials in the departments and their component agencies. What GAO Found The Departments of Energy (DOE), Health and Human Services (HHS), Justice (DOJ), and the Treasury (Treasury) had taken steps to establish policies and procedures that addressed the information technology (IT) budgeting requirements established by the Federal Information Technology Acquisition Reform Act (FITARA). However, most of the departments, or their component agencies, lacked comprehensive policies and procedures that fully addressed all of the requirements. Specifically, of the eight common baseline requirements that GAO reviewed, all four departments and their respective component agencies had fully documented one requirement in their policies and procedures, and either had partially documented or had not documented the other seven requirements. While shortfalls existed for each department, DOJ had the most comprehensive IT budgeting policies and procedures, followed by Treasury, HHS, and DOE, respectively. In addition, department chief information officers (CIO) at Treasury, HHS, and DOE had delegated many of the responsibilities for addressing the IT budgeting requirements to component CIOs\u2014thus, these component agencies were to supplement their departments' policies and procedures with their own IT budgeting policies and procedures for the responsibilities they were delegated. Among the three component agencies to which Treasury, HHS, and DOE had delegated IT budgeting responsibilities, the extent to which the components had documented requirements in their policies and procedures varied. For example, IRS had documented policies and procedures for all four of its delegated requirements. In addition, CMS had documented policies and procedures that satisfied two, partially satisfied two, and did not satisfy one of the five requirements delegated to that component. For its part, NNSA had not documented any of its five delegated",
    "gao_GAO-18-425": "Why GAO Did This Study Girls' participation in sports has increased dramatically since the passage of Title IX of the 1972 Education Amendments, which requires schools to provide equal opportunities for members of both sexes. GAO was asked to review the extent to which schools and athletics administrators have taken steps to encourage equal opportunities for boys and girls. This report examines: (1) what measures public high schools and athletics administrators have taken to encourage equal athletic opportunities for boys and girls, and (2) what factors affect boys' and girls' participation levels in public high school sports programs. GAO surveyed athletics administrators at a generalizable, stratified random sample of public high schools in the United States; reviewed federal law, regulations, and guidance; and interviewed federal officials and subject matter specialists. What GAO Found The majority of public high schools assessed some aspects of their sports programs over the past 2 years to encourage equal opportunities for boys' and girls' sports teams, according to GAO's nationally generalizable survey of athletics administrators. Specifically, the estimated percentage of schools assessing key athletic resources provided to these teams ranged from 63 percent of schools assessing travel opportunities to 76 percent assessing uniforms. Athletics administrators reported that they paid attention to the actual resources girls and boys received rather than focusing on expenditures, and three of these administrators explained there could be valid reasons for spending differences. In addition, some schools recently took steps to gauge student interest in specific sports as a means of encouraging equal opportunities, according to GAO's survey. For example, 40 percent of schools surveyed students about their sports interests over the last 2 school years and 25 percent added or changed their sports offerings based on requests from the underrepresented sex in their school's sports program. An estimated 51 percent of athletics administrators were either unaware of or unsupported by their Title IX coordinator. GAO's survey results raise questions as to whether Title IX coordinators\u2014whom school districts must designate and make visible in accordance with Title IX regulations\u2014are familiar with and using the Office for Civil Rights' (OCR) guidance on their role and responsibilities. OCR guidance states that Title IX coordinators should work closely with members of the school community, including athletics administrators, to ensure compliance with Title IX.

    "gao_GAO-18-32": "Why GAO Did This Study In 2016, the federal government spent over $1.2 billion on NAS treatment services. NAS is a withdrawal condition within infants that can result from the prenatal use of opioids by pregnant women. GAO was asked to review NAS. This report examines (1) care settings for treating infants with NAS, (2) Medicaid payment for NAS treatment, and (3) recommended practices and challenges for addressing NAS. GAO reviewed relevant literature and interviewed stakeholders, including health care providers, in four states selected based on their experience treating NAS, and reviewed HHS's strategy for addressing NAS. GAO also reviewed relevant federal laws and regulations, and interviewed officials from HHS and other stakeholders. What GAO Found According to the literature GAO reviewed, most infants with neonatal abstinence syndrome (NAS) in the United States are treated in various hospital settings, and in selected states Medicaid pays for services using bundled payments. According to the literature GAO reviewed, most infants with NAS in the United States are treated in a hospital setting, often in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU), which has a relatively high daily cost of care. Stakeholders GAO interviewed told GAO that these infants may also be treated in other hospital settings. For example, according to officials from four states, infants with NAS begin\u2014and most complete\u2014treatment for the condition in various hospital settings, which provide different levels of care: a well newborn nursery (level I), special care nursery (level II), or NICU (level III or IV). Stakeholders GAO interviewed also told GAO that some hospitals may not have the capability to provide pharmacologic treatment to infants with NAS because these hospitals may not have the staff expertise to administer the needed medication and monitor the infants who receive it. Instead, these hospitals may transfer infants with NAS who require pharmacologic treatment to hospitals with higher levels of care, such as those with a NICU. While most infants with NAS typically complete treatment in a hospital setting, stakeholders told GAO that some of these infants may be transferred to a non-hospital setting to complete pharmacologic treatment and continue non-pharmacologic treatment. HHS officials told GAO that there is not a comprehensive list of facilities that may treat infants with NAS outside of the hospital. Based",

OSHA is responsible for enforcing workplace safety and health standards, and inspects employers to ensure compliance with these standards. GAO was asked to review worker safety and health at meat and poultry plants. This report (1) describes OSHA's efforts to help ensure meat and poultry workers' safety and health, and assesses what, if any, challenges OSHA faces in carrying out these efforts; (2) examines how OSHA and the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) have collaborated to help ensure meat and poultry worker safety and health; and (3) assesses any factors that may affect OSHA and FSIS efforts to protect meat and poultry workers from chemical hazards. GAO analyzed federal laws and regulations, and interviewed federal officials and worker advocates in the meat and poultry industry, as well as representatives of worker advocacy groups. What GAO Found The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) has made efforts to help ensure meat and poultry workers' safety and health, but faces challenges identifying worker concerns. OSHA's inspections of the meat and poultry slaughter and processing industry increased from 177 in 2005 to 244 in 2016, due primarily to an increase in poultry inspections. OSHA officials said that all inspections decreased in 2013 partly due to the federal government shutdown that year. They added that poultry inspections increased from 2013 to 2016, which officials attributed to the introduction of new severe injury reporting requirements, as well as several emphasis programs focusing inspections on the poultry industry.

The Air Force, Navy, and Marine Corps have a total of more than 5,000 fighter pilots, and the Navy is acquiring and fielding new fighter aircraft. GAO was asked to review the fighter pilot workforce. This report examines the extent to which (1) the military services had differences in the number of fighter pilots compared to authorizations, as well as contributing factors and service initiatives to address the differences, and (2) the military services have reevaluated squadron requirements for the number of fighter pilots needed, including the consideration of unmanned aerial systems (UAS) pilot requirements. GAO analyzed Air Force, Navy, and Marine Corps fighter pilots and Navy and Marine Corps data for fiscal years 2013 through 2017, and interviewed service officials. What GAO Found According to Air Force, Navy, and Marine Corps data, each military service had fewer fighter pilots than authorizations (i.e., funded positions) from fiscal years 2013 through 2017, and the Air Force and the Marine Corps project that these gaps will continue for several years. According to service officials, because of low numbers of fighter pilots, the military services are unable to staff all operational fighter pilot positions. According to the military services, deploying squadrons have been fully staffed with fighter pilots, due to staffing approaches that include extending deployments and augmenting deployed squadrons with fighter pilots from other squadrons. Service officials identified multiple factors that have led to low numbers of fighter pilots, including challenges in training and retaining fighter pilots. To increase fighter pilot numbers, the military services are taking a variety of actions. The Air Force established a dedicated effort to address fighter pilot workforce challenges, and many initiatives from this effort have been implemented. The Navy and the Marine Corps are developing initiatives to address overall retention concerns. The Air Force established a dedicated team to identify and develop initiatives specifically to address its reported fighter pilot shortage, and this effort has resulted in over 35 implemented initiatives. The Navy and the Marine Corps have not formulated initiatives specifically for fighter pilots, but have identified actions to address retention concerns. Navy and Marine Corps personnel management officials GAO met with told GAO that they are closely monitoring trends in fighter pilot retention, and they believe that decreased retention in the near future may exacerbate fighter pilot gaps in their military services.

Section 964 of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Dodd-Frank Act) includes a provision for GAO to review SEC's oversight of FINRA. This report (1) determines if SEC's oversight of FINRA included the 10 areas specified in Section 964, (2) evaluates the extent to which selected SEC internal guidance on conducting examinations of FINRA follows generally accepted government auditing standards, and (3) evaluates the extent to which examinations of FINRA's governance practices followed SEC's internal guidance. GAO reviewed documentation for all SEC examinations since fiscal year 2015 (from October 2014 through April 2018), compared the current and prior versions of SEC's examination manual against generally accepted auditing standards, and interviewed pertinent staff within FINRA. What GAO Found Since fiscal year 2015, the Securities and Exchange Commission's (SEC) Office of Compliance Inspections and Examinations (OCIE) has conducted a nationwide examination and inspection program for registered self-regulatory organizations (SRO) and the Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board, an SRO that regulates the municipal bond market. OCIE conducts examinations and inspections to improve compliance, prevent fraud, monitor risk, and inform policy. Individual groups in OCIE have oversight responsibility for the various registered entities. OCIE conducts four types of reviews that may involve Section 964 areas. Program inspections are reviews of FINRA operations and program areas (for example, FINRA's review of applications by broker-dealers seeking to become members). Oversight examinations are single, stand-alone examinations of specific examinations that FINRA conducts of its member firms. FSIO initiates an oversight examination when its examinations of a broker-dealer find deficiencies FSIO believes should have been identified by FINRA in its own examination of the broker-dealer. Thematic oversight examinations are a series of oversight examinations that evaluate FINRA's review of a particular regulatory area across a number of its member firms.

The Coast Guard is also responsible for acquiring new vessels, such as the National Security Cutter, which is currently under development. This testimony discusses actions the Coast Guard could take to improve data quality and transparency of mission performance and planning. This statement is based on GAO reports issued from 2006 through 2018 on the Coast Guard's mission performance and planning. GAO also reviewed relevant Coast Guard documents and interviewed agency officials. What GAO Found GAO previously reported on actions the Coast Guard could take to ensure that, among other things, it addresses limitations posed by incomplete data, the use of unrealistic asset performance data, and limitations with its performance goal data, for more effective program management. Examples of data limitations that GAO has recommended that the Coast Guard take action on are below. Improve completeness of mission data. In December 2017, GAO found that several different federal agencies play a role in overseeing and promoting commercial fishing vessel safety, including the Coast Guard. As part of its marine safety mission, the Coast Guard conducts, among other activities, safety inspections and vessel accident investigations, including those involving commercial fishing vessels. However, GAO could not assess the number of accidents, injuries, and fatalities by fishery\u2014meaning the area in which a certain type of fish (e.g., shrimp, salmon, crab) is caught\u2014because the Coast Guard's data is not complete. Further, GAO was unable to calculate the rates of commercial fishing vessel accidents, injuries, and fatalities because reliable data on certain information needed to do so\u2014including the total number of vessels that are actively fishing and the fishery or region in which the vessel operates\u2014are either not maintained or are not collected by the Coast Guard or other federal agencies. Having this information could be useful to carrying out the Coast Guard's marine safety mission, which includes enforcing laws to prevent death, injury, and property loss in the marine environment. Use more realistic asset performance data. In May 2016, GAO reported that the Coast Guard did not provide field units with realistic goals for allocating assets, by mission.

This report examines (1) what do available data show about spending on firearms, ammunition, and selected tactical equipment made by federal agencies with 250 or more federal law enforcement officers (FLEOs) from fiscal years 2010 through 2017? (2) to what extent have selected agencies accurately reported purchases of firearms and ammunition in publicly-available data on USASpending.gov? (3) what types and quantities of firearms, ammunition, and selected tactical equipment do the Departments of Health and Human Services (HHS), Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), and Internal Revenue Service (IRS) have documented to be in their inventory systems, as of November 2017? (4) What inventory controls and procedures are in place at HHS, EPA, and IRS, and to what extent do these agencies follow these procedures at selected locations? GAO reviewed spending data from 20 agencies with at least 250 FLEOs and interviewed agency officials. GAO also reviewed inventory information and controls for case study components within IRS, HHS, and EPA.

The federal government provides a variety of programs and products that can help build home equity, including mortgage guarantees and insurance, down-payment assistance, and direct loans. GAO was asked to review the federal government's role in accelerating home equity building. This report describes (1) how federal homeownership assistance programs affect home equity building, and (2) options, including private-sector mortgage products, through which borrowers can accelerate home equity building and the trade-offs of these options for both borrowers and lenders. GAO reviewed relevant federal statutes, regulations, and agency program policies and guidance; analyzed relevant academic papers and literature; and interviewed agency officials and stakeholders, including academics, industry stakeholders, and others. What GAO Found Existing federal homeownership assistance programs use features and mechanisms that can have equity-building effects, but the programs are not specifically designed to accelerate equity building. The programs can assist homeowners to build equity over time by providing access to homeownership, but the programs do not have an explicit focus on accelerating the ongoing pace of paying down the loan principal faster than a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage. Rather, the overall focus of the programs is on providing affordable access to homeownership, according to officials of relevant agencies and entities and based on their mission goals. For example, the goal of the Federal Housing Administration's mortgage insurance program is to facilitate access to affordable mortgages for home buyers who might not otherwise be served by the private market. Federal and federally mandated programs that provide funding for grants and loans for down-payment assistance can have equity-building effects. For example, the Department of Housing and Urban Development's (HUD) HOME Investment Partnership Program provides funding to states and localities to be used exclusively for affordable housing activities to benefit low-income households. HUD's Rural Housing Service and the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) insure mortgages for home purchases, repair, and rental housing development. Federal direct loans can provide access to homeownership. For example, the Department of Veterans Affairs' Rural Housing Service and VA provide direct loans to eligible Native American veterans to finance the purchase, construction, or improvement of homes on federal trust land. Borrowers have options to accelerate equity building that include obtaining shorter-term mortgages, making more frequent or additional payments, or choosing a mortgage product available in the private mortgage market",

BLM has issued policies to manage its potential oil and gas well liabilities and reclaim orphaned wells. GAO was asked to review BLM's management of its potential liabilities. This report examines (1) how BLM's actual costs incurred to reclaim orphaned wells and potential oil and gas well liabilities have changed, if at all, for fiscal years 2010 through 2017; (2) the extent to which BLM has implemented its 2012 well review and 2013 bond adequacy review policies; and (3) BLM officials' and stakeholders' views on what challenges, if any, BLM faces in managing its potential liabilities. GAO analyzed agency data on wells and bonds, and interviewed agency officials and stakeholders. What GAO Found The Bureau of Land Management's (BLM) actual costs incurred to reclaim orphaned wells and potential oil and gas well liabilities have likely increased for fiscal years 2010 through 2017 based on GAO's analysis of available information. BLM headquarters officials GAO interviewed told GAO that they did not have any information on actual costs incurred to reclaim orphaned wells and stated that BLM's data systems were not designed to track incurred reclamation costs. In addition, GAO's analysis of Bureau of Land Management (BLM) data on wells and bonds through September 2016 found that BLM managed about 15,600 inactive wells, of which over 1,000 were inactive for 25 years or more. BLM officials said that they sometimes check AFMSS to see how many orphaned wells there are, but without doing so systematically and recording the results of these checks, it is not possible to determine how the agency has been making progress in managing the number of orphaned wells. The extent to which BLM has implemented its well review policy and bond adequacy review policy is unclear. Specifically, GAO was unable to fully assess the extent to which BLM's field and state offices have implemented directives included in these policies because of inconsistent well review information, inaccurate well and bond data, and inadequate monitoring of well and",
    "gao_GAO-19-229": "Why GAO Did This Study The Navy has 51 attack submarines, and the Navy expects to spend approximately $266 million in fiscal year 2018 constant dollars on these submarines. The Navy has not fully mitigated the challenges associated with maintaining these submarines. GAO was asked to review the Navy's maintenance of its attack submarine fleet. This report assesses the extent to which the Navy has experienced maintenance delays in its attack submarine fleet, and the extent to which the Navy has addressed any challenges and developed mitigation plans for any maintenance delays. GAO analyzed Navy maintenance data from fiscal years 2011 through 2017, and reviewed prior GAO work on shipyard maintenance delays. GAO also visited three of the four public shipyards that conduct attack submarine repair work, and interviewed officials about challenges affecting operational efficiency and performance. What GAO Found The Navy has been unable to begin or complete the vast majority of its attack submarine maintenance periods on time resulting in significant maintenance delays and operating and support cost expenditures. GAO's analysis of Navy maintenance data shows that between fiscal year 2008 and the end of fiscal year 2018, attack submarines will have incurred 10,363 days of idle time and maintenance delays as a result of delays in getting into and out of the shipyards. GAO's analysis found that the primary driver affecting attack submarines are delays in completing depot maintenance. For example, of the 10,363 total days of lost time since fiscal year 2008, 8,472 (82 percent) were due to depot maintenance delays. GAO also found that the Navy incurs significant costs in operating and supporting submarines that are experiencing maintenance delays and idle time. GAO analyzed the operating and support costs the Navy incurs on average to estimate the costs of crewing, maintaining, and supporting attack submarines that are delayed in getting into and out of the shipyards. While acknowledging the magnitude of these costs, Navy officials stated that there may be some benefits that could be realized from these operating and support costs since crews on idle attack submarines can conduct some limited training. The Navy has begun to address some challenges associated with attack submarine maintenance delays, but it has not effectively allocated maintenance periods to limit idle time and maintenance delays. For example, the Navy has hired a new workforce to address workforce shortages and facilities needs at the public shipyards. However, the Navy has not effectively allocated maintenance periods among the public and private shipyards to limit attack submarine maintenance delays. G",

VHA is responsible for ensuring that veterans receive safe and effective care. GAO was asked to review VHA's opioid safety efforts. This report examines (1) VHA's efforts to ensure that veterans are prescribed and used opioid pain medications in a safe and effective manner, and (2) VHA's adherence to key opioid risk mitigation strategies and clinical practice guideline recommendations for managing opioid therapy for chronic pain. GAO analyzed VHA data on opioid prescriptions and other trends, and reviewed relevant federal laws, regulations, and VHA policy documents. GAO also interviewed VHA officials and a nongeneralizable sample of 103 veterans who were prescribed opioids between March 2016 and March 2017. What GAO Found The Veterans Health Administration (VHA) has made progress on its Opioid Safety Initiative (OSI) goals, but performance measurement limitations exist for some goals and certain CARA requirements have not been fully implemented. VHA has made progress on most of its OSI goals, but for three goals, it is unclear if the goal has been fully met because VHA lacks documentation showing that it has implemented the required action under the goal or the required action is still in progress. For two OSI goals, VHA lacks documentation showing that it has implemented the required action under the goal or the required action is still in progress. Without sufficient documentation and measurable outcomes, VHA cannot determine whether these OSI goals have been fully achieved. VHA providers at selected VHA medical facilities do not consistently follow three key opioid risk mitigation strategies, two of which are required under VHA policy. Specifically, increasing the use of urine drug screening is an explicit goal of VHA's OSI, and providers should generally ensure that an annual urine drug screening has been conducted. However, GAO found that of the 53 veterans who received long-term opioid therapy, 32 veterans received an annual urine drug screening, 13 veterans had their names queried annually in a state prescription drug monitoring program, and 41 veterans had provided informed consent indicating that they had been educated on the risks and benefits of opioid use. GAO also found that some VHA providers at selected facilities do not consistently follow selected clinical practice guideline recommendations related to opioid safety. For example, 20 percent of veterans in GAO's sample were prescribed",
    "gao_GAO-19-233": "Why GAO Did This Study The Marine Corps has been aware for years of the challenges it faces in explaining its resource needs in its budget estimates to Congress. GAO was asked to review the Marine Corps' efforts to link resources to readiness. This report evaluates the extent to which the Marine Corps (1) tracks unit-level Operations and Maintenance (O&M) training funds for ground combat forces through the budget cycle; and (2) links unit-level training funds for ground combat forces to readiness. GAO analyzed fiscal year 2017 funding data from three Marine Expeditionary Forces (MEF)\u2014Camp Pendleton, California; II MEF\u2014Camp Lejeune, North Carolina; and III MEF\u2014Okinawa, Japan. GAO also reviewed reports and supporting documentation on Marine Corps efforts to evaluate readiness levels achieved from O&M obligations for ground combat forces training and observed the operation of systems used to track training funds and readiness. What GAO Found GAO's analysis of fiscal year 2017 funding data from the three Marine Expeditionary Forces (MEF) for fiscal year 2017 shows that the MEFs had some data available that could be used to track some training funds from budget request to obligation. However, the Marine Corps cannot fully track all training funds through the budget cycle because the Office of Programs and Resources has not established the consistent use of fiscal codes to provide greater detail about the use of funds across the budget cycle phases, and the accuracy of these fiscal codes is sometimes questionable. Two key fiscal codes that officials identified as relevant to efforts to track funds for unit-level training are the Marine Corps Programming Code (MCPC) and the Special Interest Code (SIC). However, GAO identified limitations with how these fiscal codes are applied, as detailed below. MCPCs are used to program funds for intended use, but are not clearly linked to executed funds. When the Marine Corps programs funds for intended use, it uses MCPCs to identify the funds; however, when it executes those funds, it uses a different set of fiscal codes to identify them. As a result, the Marine Corps cannot link the programmed intent of the funds to the execution of the funds, making it difficult to track funds through the budget cycle. SICs are not used consistently across units. Units, including the MEF and its subordinate units, do not consistently use SICs in identifying funds associated with all training exercises. Specifically, units, including the MEF and",

NASA's portfolio of major projects includes the Orion Multi-Purpose Crew Vehicle (Orion), the Space Launch System (SLS), and the Exploration Ground Systems (EGS). This statement discusses (1) the cost and schedule performance of NASA's portfolio of major projects and (2) the composition of the portfolio in the coming years. This statement is based on GAO's May 2018 report, NASA's Acquisition Management: Cost and Schedule Performance Decreased Between May 2017 and May 2018, and a review of NASA's acquisition management. GAO reviewed NASA's acquisition management policies and procedures, and interviewed agency officials. What GAO Found The cost and schedule performance of NASA's portfolio of major projects deteriorated between May 2017 and May 2018, but the extent of cost growth is unknown. NASA lacks a current cost estimate for its Orion crew capsule\u2014one of the largest programs in its portfolio\u2014but expects the program will exceed its cost baseline when NASA updates the program's life-cycle cost estimate. Because the Orion program accounts for about 22 percent of all development costs, even a small percentage of cost growth for the Orion program could significantly affect portfolio cost performance. The known negative cost and schedule performance is largely driven by four projects\u2014SLS, EGS, Space Network Ground Segment Sustainment (SGSS), and Mars 2020\u2014that experienced technical challenges compounded by programmatic challenges. Together, these projects experienced $638 million in cost growth and 59 months in aggregate schedule delays. Two projects\u2014JWST and ICESat-2\u2014experienced schedule delays due to technical challenges identified during integration and test. Another 3 projects\u2014NASA Indian Space Research Organisation Synthetic Aperture Radar (NISAR), ICON, and GRACE-FO\u2014experienced cost growth or delays largely due to factors outside of the projects' control, such as launch vehicle delays. The composition of the portfolio in the coming years is expected to include large and complex projects, putting NASA at risk of continued cost increases and schedule delays. Specifically, NASA plans to have complex projects enter the development portfolio in the next few years as it holds confirmation reviews and set cost and schedule baselines. This includes the Europa Clipper project and potentially the Wide-Field Infrared Survey Telescope (WF",
    "gao_GAO-19-230": "Why GAO Did This Study Identity theft occurs when individuals' information is used without authorization in an attempt to commit fraud or other crimes. In 2016, according to the Bureau of Justice Statistics, an estimated 26 million people\u201410 percent of U.S. residents aged 16 or older\u2014reported that they had been victims of identity theft in the previous year. GAO was asked to review options consumers can use to prevent or address the risks resulting from data breaches. This report examines (1) information and expert views about the effectiveness of options consumers can use to prevent or address the risks resulting from data breaches; and (2) federal assistance available to help consumers understand these options, including the status of one matter for congressional consideration and one recommendation relating to these issues in GAO's 2017 report. GAO reviewed relevant literature and interviewed representatives of consumer, government, and industry organizations, and identity theft service providers. GAO also reviewed relevant consumer education materials and interviewed officials from federal agencies, consumer groups, and industry associations. What GAO Found Information that can help consumers assess their options for mitigating and addressing the risks of identity theft and other harm from data breaches is limited. Specifically, GAO did not identify any studies that analyzed whether consumers who sign up for or purchase identity theft services encounter fewer instances of identity theft or detect instances of financial or other fraud more\u2014or less\u2014rapidly than consumers who take steps on their own. Views of experts varied, but most said identity theft services have limitations and would not address all data breach risks. Most experts also said that a credit freeze, which consumers place on their own for free, is a useful way to prevent one type of financial fraud\u2014the illegal opening of new credit accounts in consumers' names. Based on GAO's review and discussions with experts, consumers can consider four factors when deciding on options to address risks after a data breach: the extent to which an option might prevent fraud; the cost of an option; its convenience; and the type of information that was exposed and may be at risk. Among federal agencies, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) serves as a primary source for free assistance to consumers on issues related to data breaches and identity theft. Approximately 13 percent of those affected by the 2015 data breaches at OPM used credit and identity monitoring and identity restoration services that OPM offered them and a fraction of a percent made identity theft insurance claims (the payouts for which averaged $1,",

The Act also required VA to submit a plan to Congress and GAO within 90 days of enactment. GAO was asked to review VA's appeals plan. This report assesses the extent to which VA's appeals plan addresses the Act's required elements. GAO reviewed VA's appeals plan and supplemental materials, and interviewed VA officials. What GAO Found The Department of Veterans Affairs' (VA) appeals plan addresses 17 of the Act's 22 required elements, partially addresses 4 related to monitoring implementation and workforce planning, and does not address 1 element related to identifying total resources. For example, VA's appeals plan addresses the required elements related to, among other things, identifying legal authorities for hiring and removing employees, estimating timeliness for hiring and training employees, and outlining the outreach VA expects to conduct. However, VA officials said they disagreed and that their appeals plan addresses all 22 of the required elements. In general, they said that data are not available, and VA cannot yet forecast the information required by the Act until aspects of the new appeals process are tested or implemented. However, in discussing GAO's assessment at a January 2018 House Committee on Veterans' Affairs hearing, the Deputy Secretary of Veterans Affairs stated that the agency agreed with GAO's assessment and will work with GAO to address these gaps in VA's appeals plan. VA's appeals plan reflects certain sound planning practices, such as convening a working group on performance tracking; however, the plan could benefit from including important details related to three key planning areas: 1. articulating a balanced set of goals and related measures to monitor and assess the performance of the new appeals process, in conjunction with the legacy process; 2. developing a high-quality and reliable implementation schedule to manage key steps and activities of the project; and 3. assessing key risks in a comprehensive manner, including respective mitigation strategies, articulating clear criteria and an assessment plan for RAMP, and more fully testing or analyzing all appeals options.

    "gao_GAO-18-298": "Why GAO Did This Study IRS relies on IT to support its mission of providing America's taxpayers with top quality service. GAO has previously reported on the performance of IRS's IT investments and identified opportunities for improving the management of these investments. GAO was asked to review IRS's IT investments. This report (1) evaluates the performance of selected IRS IT investments, (2) summarizes any risks associated with selected legacy systems and evaluates the steps IRS has taken to manage them, and (3) determines the extent to which IRS has implemented key IT workforce planning practices. GAO analyzed IRS's fiscal year 2016 IT investments, reviewed relevant documentation, and interviewed agency officials. What GAO Found The performance of selected Internal Revenue Service (IRS) information technology (IT) investments has varied. In this regard, GAO found that the four selected investments in development had spent less than planned, and that most were behind schedule and had delivered less scope than planned. In addition most of these investments had significant variances, meaning that actual cost, schedule, or scope varied from plans by more than 10 percent. For the five selected investments in the operations and maintenance phase, GAO found that most had met all of their operational performance targets and all performed operational analyses required by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB). However, none of the analyses addressed all key factors specified in OMB's guidance. Until IRS addresses the shortcomings noted for the selected operational investments, the agency risks not having critical information needed to determine whether the investments fully meet intended objectives and whether there are alternative ways to efficiently meet the agency's mission. Three selected investments GAO reviewed\u2014IMF, IDRS, and MSSS\u2014are facing significant risks due to their reliance on legacy programming languages, outdated hardware, and a shortage of human resources with critical skills. However, IRS has not implemented steps needed to effectively manage these risks\u2014and thus, the agency's ability to carry out its tax processing and modernization efforts may be impacted. Two of the three investments\u2014IMF and IDRS\u2014rely on legacy programming languages, resulting in increased risk to continuing operation of these investments. Specifically, IRS reported that IMF is written in assembly language code and COBOL, and IDRS is written in COBOL. As a result, the investment is at risk of not being able to successfully process tax information. IRS has not fully implemented all of the key practices for managing risks for any of the three selected",
    "gao_GAO-18-679": "Why GAO Did This Study TCS programs provide scholarships to students who meet certain income and other criteria. In fiscal year 2017, the Department of Education awarded about $1.2 billion in scholarships to students. The Department of the Treasury's Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (Treasury) and the Department of the Treasury's Office of the Inspector General (IRG) are responsible for administering TCS programs. GAO was asked to review TCS programs. This report examines (1) how TCS program donations determine student eligibility and consider other factors when determining scholarship award amounts, and (2) the extent to which TCS program donations affect the amount that donors owe in state and federal taxes. GAO reviewed relevant laws, regulations, and program documents; analyzed program data; and interviewed officials from the 22 TCS programs authorized across 18 states. What GAO Found The 22 state TCS programs often determine student eligibility for scholarships based on household income and use a range of factors to determine scholarship award amounts. Seventeen of the 22 programs have income limits (i.e., the maximum amount of household income a student can have and still be eligible for a scholarship). Sixteen of the 17 programs have income limits above their state's median income. Seventeen of the 22 programs allow students to use their scholarship money for costs like transportation and books in addition to tuition, while the remaining programs require scholarships funds to be used for tuition only. The extent to which TCS program donations affect the amount that donors owe in state and federal taxes depends on program characteristics, such as the percentage of the donation that the rules of the program allow donors to claim as a state tax credit (referred to in this report as \"tax credit percentages\") and limits on donation amounts. Eleven of the 22 programs allow eligible donors (either individuals, businesses, or both) to claim 100 percent of their donations as state tax credits, meaning that, for each dollar donated, the amount of state taxes owed (i.e., the donor's tax liability) is reduced by a dollar, up to any maximum donation limits set by the program. The other 11 programs offer tax credits of 50 percent to 85 percent of donations. All but one of the programs prohibits donors from receiving a tax credit greater than their tax liability in a given year, although two thirds of the programs allow donors to carry forward portions of the credits to use in future years.

HUD's Supportive Housing for the Elderly (Section 202) program for renters and the Home Equity Conversion Mortgage program for homeowners are the only programs that specifically target older households. HUD and USDA have programs that do not target, but serve a significant number of older households. GAO was asked to review HUD's and USDA's efforts to address the housing needs of older adults. This report examines (1) the extent to which HUD, HHS, and USDA collaborated on housing assistance and health services for older adults, and (2) the extent to which HUD and HHS collaborated on housing and health services for older adults. GAO reviewed relevant laws, policies, and reports; interviewed HUD and HHS officials; and analyzed HUD and HHS data on housing assistance and health services for older adults. What GAO Found The Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), and the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) collaborated on some housing assistance and health services for older adults, but these efforts did not include USDA or define common outcomes for these efforts. For example, HUD's Section 202 program is the only program that provides supportive housing targeted to very low-income older adults. HUD's Section 202 program is the only program that provides supportive housing targeted to very low-income older adults. HUD's Section 515 Rural Rental Housing program is the only program that provides rental subsidies to low-income, elderly, or disabled households living in properties funded by the Section 515 Rural Rental Housing program and others. HUD and USDA have programs that previously added to the supply of affordable housing but no longer do so. For example, HUD's Section 202 program has primarily funded contract renewals for existing rental assistance and for service coordinators. HUD and USDA have collaborated on some housing assistance and health services for older adults, but these efforts were not focused specifically on older adults. For example, HUD and USDA collaborated on administrative initiatives through the Rental Policy Working Group, which was established in 1991 to coordinate the provision of home and community-based services and supports to vulnerable populations, including older adults.

DOD has taken actions to improve data quality of some data elements through financial improvement and audit readiness efforts. However, deficiencies in the processes for recording and reporting real property data continue to lead to inaccurate and incomplete information. GAO was asked to review DOD's real property management. This report examines the extent to which DOD's real property data are accurate and complete and the extent to which DOD has addressed risks to its ability to use information to manage its real property. GAO analyzed DOD real property data from fiscal years 2014 through 2016 and reviewed DOD policies, procedures, and other documents. GAO also interviewed OSD and military service officials. What GAO Found The Department of Defense's (DOD) real property data system for real property\u2014the Real Property Asset Database (RPAD)\u2014contained inaccurate and incomplete data and lacks completeness. GAO's analysis of RPAD data from fiscal years 2014 through 2016 found improvements in certain data elements, such as the operational status of an asset, asset review date, and plant replacement value. However, GAO found that the magnitude of such discrepancies decreased while others increased from fiscal year 2014 to fiscal year 2016. For example, the percentage of facilities with a missing review date increased from 3.4 percent in fiscal year 2014 to 7.2 percent in fiscal year 2016. RPAD did not include all of DOD's existing real property assets in fiscal years 2014 through 2016, resulting in an incomplete data set. Specifically, GAO found (1) the military services have not recorded all assets that existed and reflected previously disposed facilities that no longer existed as active in their respective data systems, (2) the military services did not report all assets in the RPAD submission to OSD that were recorded in each military service's data system, and (3) OSD did not include all assets reported by the military services in RPAD. Moreover, GAO found that the number of facilities OSD did not include in RPAD ranged from about 3,300 facilities (0.5 percent) to 19,400 facilities (2.6 percent) of the facilities reported by the military services and the Department of Homeland Security (DHS). DOD's processes for recording and reporting real property data have deficiencies that contribute to inaccuracies and incompleteness in the RPAD data. Specifically, GAO identified inconsist",

IRS has also been required to hold refunds for all taxpayers claiming EITC or ACTC until February 15. The Protecting Americans from Tax Hikes Act of 2015 required GAO to review IRS's implementation of the act. This report assesses IRS's performance in detecting fraud and noncompliance using systemic verification, and the extent to which IRS analyzed the effectiveness of the refund hold on systemic verification as well as opportunities for IRS to apply systemic verification to other efforts to detect fraud and noncompliance. GAO reviewed IRS documents and data, and interviewed IRS officials and other experts. What GAO Found The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) has made progress in detecting fraud and noncompliance using systemic verification, which matches taxpayer returns with third-party data to identify and prevent fraud and noncompliance. However, IRS did not have all W-2 data in time to conduct pre-refund checks of wages, withholding, and other information before issuing refunds, especially early in the filing season. IRS received and initially processed about 35.1 million individual tax returns through February 14, representing nearly $200 billion in refunds. However, IRS did not have all W-2 data in time to conduct pre-refund checks of wages, withholding, and other information before issuing refunds, especially early in the filing season.

In 2016, VA began a transition to MSPV-NG, a new program that limits the range of items medical centers can purchase. GAO was asked to review VA's transition to MSPV-NG. This report addresses the extent to which (1) VA's implementation of MSPV-NG was effective in meeting program goals, and (2) VA has awarded contracts on an emergency basis for routine supplies and ongoing services, and what impact, if any, these awards have on VA's acquisition function. GAO reviewed VA policies and guidance, analyzed VA data, and interviewed VA officials and supply chain managers from four hospital networks. What GAO Found The Department of Veterans Affairs' (VA) implementation of the Medical Surgical Prime Vendor-Next Generation (MSPV-NG) program\u2014from its initial work to identify a list of supply requirements in 2015, through its roll-out of the formulary to medical centers in December 2016\u2014was not executed in line with leading practices. Specifically, VA lacked a documented program strategy, leadership stability, and workforce capacity for the transition that\u2014if in place\u2014could have facilitated buy-in for the change throughout the organization. Furthermore, the initial requirements development process and tight time frames contributed to ineffective contracting processes. As a result, VA developed an initial formulary that did not meet the needs of the medical centers. VA made some changes in the second phase of requirements development to address deficiencies identified in the initial roll out, namely by increasing the level of clinical involvement. However, VHA has not yet achieved its goals for utilization and cost avoidance. VA designated a substantial number of its procurements in fiscal year 2016 as emergencies, and GAO found that it frequently uses emergency procurements to buy routine supplies and ongoing services that do not warrant the emergency designation defined in VHA guidance. Among the 18 contract actions GAO reviewed from three Veterans Integrated Service Networks, GAO found instances of emergency procurements caused by shortcomings in planning, funding, and communication. These emergency procurements strain the capacity of VA's acquisition workforce and put the government at risk of paying more than it should for goods and services. Among the 18 contract actions GAO reviewed, GAO found instances of emergency procurements caused by shortcomings in planning, funding, and communication.",
    "gao_GAO-19-219": "Why GAO Did This Study In fiscal year 2018, the MEP program provided financial assistance to 51 MEP centers, which provide services to manufacturers. In fiscal year 2017, the AICA cost share adjustment was enacted to increase federal assistance to MEP centers and to reset the cost share to 1:1. The AICA included a provision for GAO to review the AICA cost share adjustment. This report describes (1) MEP centers' views regarding the extent to which the AICA cost share adjustment has helped them serve manufacturers and (2) the extent to which NIST data show impacts of the cost share adjustment on centers' finances and activities. GAO surveyed all 51 MEP centers and received a response from every center. GAO also interviewed officials from nine MEP centers, selected based on factors such as the number of manufacturers in the state, and whether the center is operated by a nonprofit, state agency, or university. What GAO Found In response to GAO's survey, most Manufacturing Extension Partnership (MEP) centers reported that the 2017 American Innovation and Competitiveness Act (AICA) cost share adjustment has helped them serve manufacturers, but some center officials indicated that the impact is hard to measure. Specifically, most MEP centers GAO surveyed reported that the AICA's adjustment of the cost share to 1:1 for the life of a center's cooperative agreement has increased their financial stability and helped them serve very small and rural manufacturers. According to the survey results, centers run by nonprofit organizations reported greater impacts of the cost share adjustment than those run by states or universities. In follow-up interviews, some MEP center officials indicated that the impact is difficult to measure because of other recent changes that have also impacted their ability to serve manufacturers. NIST data show that there have been some changes in MEP centers' finances and activities since the 2017 AICA cost share adjustment. However, these changes generally began around the time NIST recompeted the centers' cooperative agreements, before the enactment of the AICA, and cannot necessarily be linked to the cost share adjustment. NIST data show that the total number of manufacturers MEP centers reported serving increased from approximately 8,000 to 8,400, very small manufacturers MEP centers reported serving increased from approximately 2,600 to 2,700, and rural manufacturers MEP centers reported serving increased from approximately 1,500 to 1,600.

OMB and GSA have been involved in shared services reform efforts for decades. GAO was asked to review the federal government's efforts to promote shared services. This report (1) identifies the progress and challenges associated with federal shared services initiatives for selected human resources (HR) and financial management activities, and (2) assesses OMB and GSA's actions to address those challenges. GAO reviewed relevant reports and OMB and GSA documents and interviewed officials from OMB and GSA, the agencies that oversee shared services policy and guidance, and the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) and the Office of Financial Innovation and Transformation (FIT). GAO also reviewed OMB and GSA's efforts to identify and address challenges and lessons learned from past migrations. What GAO Found OMB's efforts to promote HR shared services resulted in cost savings, cost avoidance, and more consistent service delivery. OMB announced the HR Line of Business in 2004 simultaneously with the Financial Management Line of Business. These shared services initiatives shared similar goals: (1) standardize systems, business processes, and data elements to promote consistency across the federal government; and (2) reduce costs by establishing a marketplace or a system of buying and selling products and services. OMB designated FIT as managing partner of the Financial Management Line of Business and designated four FSSPs to provide financial management services to other agencies. FIT also worked with the Chief Human Capital Officers community to develop more than 40 business use cases for financial management activities. FIT officials estimated these projects could contribute to cost savings of around $620 million over 5 years, but they did not track cost savings. Wider adoption of HR and financial management shared services has been impeded by challenges in two areas. First, shared services efforts have faced persistent governance challenges, such as limited interagency collaboration, difficulty reconciling benefits and trade-offs, and limited oversight and technical support for shared services migrations. Second, the efforts have also experienced marketplace challenges, which involve difficulty obtaining funding to invest in shared services, demand uncertainty among providers, and limited choices for customers. These issues hampered efforts to establish effective and efficient shared services marketplaces. As a result, these marketplaces have not been able to consistently support sufficient competition limiting the potential cost sharing efficiencies and improved performance that could be realized with greater usage.",

ARPA-E is responsible for identifying and funding energy technology projects that accelerate transformational technological advances in areas that industry on its own is not likely to undertake because of technical and financial uncertainty, while also ensuring that its activities are coordinated with, and do not duplicate, the efforts of, programs and laboratories within DOE and other relevant research agencies. GAO was asked to review DOE's financial assistance review process. This report examines (1) the extent to which DOE developed and implemented a new review process to assess DOE's financial assistance for new work against the current administration's priorities, and (2) the extent to which DOE's review process created uncertainty for ARPA-E selectees. GAO reviewed relevant laws and regulations, and interviewed officials from DOE and 10 ARPA-E selectees selected based on their projects' funding amounts and technology readiness level. What GAO Found In 2017, the Department of Energy (DOE) developed and implemented a new review process to assess DOE financial assistance for new work against the current administration's priorities, including financial assistance for which ARPA-E had already made award selections. DOE reviewed and approved ARPA-E's opportunities for financial assistance on a rolling basis from May to September 2017, and nearly all were approved to proceed. DOE's financial assistance review lasted through September 2017, as some DOE organizations continued to submit new financial assistance for review, but that the review was largely completed by August 10, 2017. However, while the formal review of DOE financial assistance began in May, award negotiations for ARPA-E-funded projects were suspended nearly 1 month earlier. Specifically, according to ARPA-E officials, DOE's Deputy Chief of Staff verbally directed ARPA-E on April 6, 2017 to stop all ongoing award negotiations. According to the 10 ARPA-E selectees GAO interviewed, DOE's financial assistance review process created uncertainty, which led to a variety of impacts\u2014the most frequently cited of which were potentially delayed project timelines and difficulties staffing project teams. Selectees told GAO that they received little communication from ARPA-E during the review process, and they indicated that additional information about review timelines and potential effects on their awards would have helped them manage some of the uncertainty they experienced during the review process.

    "gao_GAO-18-198": "Why GAO Did This Study Wireless networks are vital to the nation's communications infrastructure, but they also face physical risks, such as natural disasters and other emergencies. FCC regulates wireless networks and carriers, and FCC has reported that the loss of backhaul service is a major cause of a cell site's unavailability. GAO was asked to review wireless network resiliency since 2013. This report examines (1) trends in wireless outages attributed to physical incidents since 2009 as reported to FCC, (2) actions federal agencies and industry have taken since 2013 to improve wireless network resiliency, and (3) options that federal agencies could take to improve network resiliency and their advantages and disadvantages. GAO analyzed FCC data on wireless outages from 2009 through 2016, reviewed relevant literature, and interviewed FCC and DHS officials and industry stakeholders. What GAO Found The number of wireless outages attributed to a physical incident increased from 2009 to 2016, and outages due to natural disasters lasted longest trends in number and reported causes of wireless outages. Specifically, the number of outages with a physical incident reported as a root cause increased from 189 outages in 2009 to 1,079 in 2016. The number of outages increased substantially during the first few years of this period and then was relatively stable, which mirrored the trend for all wireless outages. According to FCC officials, the increase in reported outages was due to increases in both the number of wireless customers and wireless infrastructure over this period, as well as due to FCC's outreach to wireless companies to clarify the thresholds for which carriers are required to report wireless outages to help ensure that carriers were consistently and fully reporting outages. From 2009 to 2016, about one-third of all wireless outages reported to FCC (6,002 of 18,325) were attributed to physical incidents. Of wireless outages attributed to physical incidents, most were due to accidents, such as cable damage due to a backhoe cut, which was the root cause for 74 percent of wireless outages attributed to a physical incident. Natural disasters\u2014including tornados and wildfires\u2014were the root cause for 25 percent of wireless outages attributed to a physical incident. Manmade events\u2014which include damage associated with theft or other intentional damage to facilities\u2014were rarely reported as the cause or contributing factor. The number of wireless outages",
    "gao_GAO-18-136": "Why GAO Did This Study USAID and State provide funding for democracy assistance programs, including contracts, grants, and cooperative agreements. USAID and State have obligated about $2 billion annually for democracy assistance through contracts, grants, and cooperative agreements. GAO was asked to review USAID's democracy assistance funding. This report (1) examines funding that USAID, NED, and State obligated for democracy assistance through contracts, grants, and cooperative agreements; (2) evaluates USAID documentation of award-type decisions; and (3) compares USAID contracts with grants and cooperative agreements across selected award elements. GAO analyzed USAID, NED, and State data on democracy assistance obligations for fiscal years 2012 through 2016, reviewed relevant regulations and agency policies, and interviewed agency officials. What GAO Found The U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) obligated $5.5 billion in democracy assistance funding during fiscal years 2012 through 2016, and the U.S. Department of State (State) obligated $610.2 million in democracy assistance funding, and the total such funding that State obligated cannot be reliably determined. USAID obligated $5.5 billion in democracy assistance funding during fiscal years 2012 through 2016, about 31 percent through contracts; 33 percent through cooperative agreements; and 4 percent through grants, excluding grants to public international organizations (PIO). USAID obligated more through grants and cooperative agreements combined than contracts, but its obligations through different award types varied by fiscal year and Democracy, Human Rights, and Governance (DRG) program area. NED provided democracy assistance only through grants, and its obligations remained generally constant by fiscal year but varied by DRG program area. State bureaus that were able to provide reliable data provided democracy assistance primarily through grants and cooperative agreements. INL was the only State bureau that reported providing a significant amount of democracy assistance through contracts in addition to grants and cooperative agreements, but INL was one of the three State bureaus unable to provide reliable data. USAID generally did not document award-type decisions in a complete and timely manner for the awards in GAO's sample. Specifically, USAID provided documentation of the award-type decision for 5 of the 41 awards in GAO's sample. For the remaining 36 awards, the documentation was either incomplete, not timely, or both. USAID recently introduced processes and procedures to improve the documentation of award-type decisions, but until USAID assesses its updated",
    "gao_GAO-18-486": "Why GAO Did This Study In fiscal year 2017, states paid an estimated $1.36 billion in Unemployment Insurance (UI) benefits to claimants who failed to meet work search requirements. GAO was asked to review work search overpayments. This report examines (1) trends in reported work search overpayments and (2) state practices and other factors that may be associated with work search overpayments. GAO analyzed DOL data on work search overpayments and state work search overpayment rate estimates for fiscal years 2013 through 2017, reviewed relevant federal laws and regulations, and interviewed DOL officials. What GAO Found Nationally, the estimated work search overpayment rate and the estimated amount of work search overpayments have risen in recent years. Specifically, in fiscal year 2013, approximately $1 billion in estimated work search overpayments were made to claimants who were not actively searching for work and, in fiscal year 2017, the amount increased to close to an estimated $1.36 billion. The national work search overpayment rate for such claimants also increased during this time. According to DOL data, in fiscal year 2017, about 0 to 41 percent of the UI benefits that states paid in fiscal year 2017 were made to claimants who were not actively searching for work. GAO's analysis of DOL data found that certain state administrative practices, including investigating a higher percentage of claimant-reported work search activities and frequent use of formal warnings, were associated with lower reported state work search overpayment rates. However, DOL recently determined that federal law does not permit states to warn claimants the first time they fail to meet work search requirements (i.e., issue formal warnings) instead of establishing that an overpayment was made. Additionally, a higher percentage of claimants required to search for work is associated with higher reported state work search overpayment rates. GAO's analysis of DOL data shows that in fiscal year 2017, estimated work search overpayments were nearly $1.4 billion, but potentially would have been an estimated $1.8 billion greater if states had not issued formal warnings and established overpayments. However, DOL recently determined that federal law does not permit states to issue formal warnings instead of establishing that an overpayment was made. Additionally, a higher percentage of claimants required to search for work is associated with higher reported state work search overpayment rates.

FRA is responsible for providing regulatory oversight of the safety of both freight and passenger railroads. FRA issued regulations in 2006 to reduce the risks of accidents at grade crossings. The Fixing America's Surface Transportation Act included provisions for GAO to review the effectiveness of FRA's final rule governing the use of train horns at highway-rail grade crossings. This report examines (1) what is known about the benefits and costs of quiet zones, (2) what challenges, if any, public authorities and others encounter in establishing quiet zones, and (3) how, if at all, FRA is evaluating the effectiveness of federal train horn regulations. GAO reviewed relevant literature and FRA regulations and guidance; interviewed FRA program officials and other stakeholders; and conducted in-depth interviews with a nongeneralizable sample of 40 stakeholders selected based on factors such as the number of new quiet zones and the number of grade crossings in new quiet zones. What GAO Found Benefits derived from establishing quiet zones and reducing noise from the train horn have not been quantified in research GAO reviewed or by the public authorities (i.e., communities) that GAO interviewed. Specifically, GAO's review of literature did not identify any studies that had quantified the benefits resulting from public authorities establishing quiet zones at grade crossings where the horn was previously sounded. Further, FRA has not quantified benefits associated with quiet zones, but did note in its Regulatory Evaluation and Regulatory Flexibility Assessment for Use of Locomotive Horns at Highway-Rail Grade Crossings Final Rule (RFIA) that quiet zones would likely result in localized quality-of-life benefits from silencing of the horn at locations where it had previously been sounded. Finally, none of the public authorities GAO interviewed have conducted any analysis that has quantified benefits associated with quiet zones or were aware of any studies that quantified these benefits. Selected public authorities and other stakeholders that GAO spoke with reported several challenges with establishing quiet zones and suggested improvements to the process. These stakeholders cited three primary challenges, which included the cost to establish quiet zones, obtaining stakeholder cooperation, and the process for establishing quiet zones. These stakeholders cited three primary challenges, which included",
    "gao_GAO-18-477": "Why GAO Did This Study The United States has a 90-day obligation to hold the equivalent of net imports of crude oil and petroleum products. The United States also has a 90-day obligation to release reserves in the event of a collective action to respond to a supply disruption. GAO was asked to review the SPR. This report examines (1) how the United States and other IEA members meet their obligations and hold significant proportions of their reserves as petroleum products rather than as crude oil, and (2) the extent to which DOE has identified the optimal size for the SPR or the potential need for additional regional product reserves. GAO analyzed IEA data on member reserves as of December 2017, reviewed DOE's 2016 long-term strategic review of the SPR, and interviewed agency officials and experts. What GAO Found In terms of how the United States and other IEA members meet their obligations, most other IEA members differ from the United States in two basic ways. Specifically, as of December 2017, most IEA members rely at least in part on private rather than public reserves to meet their obligations, and most hold significant proportions of their reserves as petroleum products rather than as crude oil. Unlike the United States, most IEA members hold at least a third of their reserves as petroleum products rather than as crude oil. In contrast, more than 99 percent of the SPR (665.5 million barrels as of March 2018) is held as crude oil, all of which is stored at the four storage sites in Louisiana and Texas. While DOE has examined a range of sizes for the SPR, it has not identified the optimal size for the SPR to meet U.S. energy security needs and IEA obligations, and DOE's analysis of SPR sizes was limited in three ways. DOE did not fully evaluate the implications of falling net imports of crude oil and petroleum products with respect to meeting the International Energy Agency's (IEA) 90-day reserve obligation and to respond to collective actions. DOE's analysis did not fully consider the potential effects of falling net imports on meeting the IEA 90-day reserve obligation or the role that increased levels of private reserves could play in responding to supply disruptions. Without conducting additional analysis, DOE cannot provide information to Congress to inform decisions about the optimal size of the SPR and risks holding too much or too little in the SPR to meet the United States' evolving energy",

Participants may apply for a voucher from a PHA, and find a rental unit within a limited time frame. GAO was asked to review fraud schemes against HCV program participants. This report describes (1) the types of reported fraud schemes committed against HCV program participants (including older adults), awareness by PHAs and other relevant organizations of fraud incidents and how often they occur, and indicators of such schemes online; and (2) antifraud regulations, guidance, and informational materials, if any, that HUD and PHAs have in place to identify and mitigate fraud against program participants. GAO analyzed HCV program fraud alerts and consumer complaint data from the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), reviewed relevant laws and regulations, and interviewed officials from HUD, FTC, and other relevant organizations. What GAO Found Fraud schemes against Housing Choice Voucher (HCV) program participants\u2014including prospective applicants, individuals on waiting lists, current voucher holders, and landlords providing rental units\u2014can occur at each point in the HCV application and rental process, according to program officials and GAO's analysis of FTC complaint data. Fraudsters perpetrate reported schemes in a variety of ways, such as through in-person impersonation of PHA staff or by manipulating telephone numbers to convince landlords to make unnecessary payments. Fraudsters perpetrate reported schemes in a variety of ways, such as through in-person impersonation of PHA staff or by manipulating telephone numbers to convince landlords to make unnecessary payments. GAO surveyed a nationally representative sample of Public Housing Agencies (PHA) from spring 2016 through spring 2017. GAO asked about fraudsters promising placement onto or a higher place on a waiting list, selling vouchers, stealing security deposits, or offering suspect credit-report services. Fraudsters perpetrate reported schemes in a variety of ways, such as through in-person impersonation of PHA staff or by manipulating telephone numbers to convince landlords to make unnecessary payments. GAO's survey results and interviews with PHA officials and other relevant organizations were consistent with the results of GAO's survey.

Puerto Rico and its residents are generally subject to the same federal laws as the states and their residents, except in cases where specific exemptions have been made, such as with certain federal programs. In May 2016, DOL published a final rule that would increase the salary level threshold for exempt employees from overtime pay. GAO was asked to review the economic conditions in Puerto Rico. This report examines (1) the economic conditions in Puerto Rico as of the end of 2016; and (2) the potential effects of implementing the 2016 Overtime Rule on Puerto Rico's economy. GAO analyzed Puerto Rico's economic data from 1990 through 2016 and passenger data for Puerto Rican airports for years 2016 and 2017; reviewed relevant federal laws, regulations, and agency guidance; and interviewed agency officials and experts. What GAO Found Puerto Rico's economic condition is difficult to evaluate prior to Hurricane Maria, which devastated Puerto Rico and left nearly all its residents without potable running water and electricity. In addition, the existing infrastructure for cellular and wireless service was rendered virtually useless, hampering communication. Four months after Hurricane Maria, more than a third of Puerto Rico's energy customers remained without power. The lack of power and communication impeded residents' ability to return to work. According to the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), rebuilding will take years. The Puerto Rico Oversight, Management, and Economic Stability Act (PROMESA) established a Financial Oversight and Management Board for Puerto Rico (Oversight Board), and granted it broad powers of fiscal and budgetary control over Puerto Rico. The Overtime Rule was enacted in May 2016 and was intended to increase the salary level threshold for exempt employees from overtime pay. The 2016 Overtime Rule would have applied to Puerto Rico; however, on June 30, 2016, prior to the rule's effective date of December 1, 2016, PROMESA was enacted which, in part, delayed the applicability of this rule to Puerto Rico. In the interim, the 2004 Overtime Rule salary level threshold for exempt employees of $23,660 remained in effect. In October 2017, DOL filed a motion to appeal that ruling with the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals. In November 2017, DOL filed a motion to stay the appeal pending the outcome of its rulemaking, and the Fifth Circuit granted this",

The breach affected 143 million U.S. consumers. GAO was asked to review the breach. This report (1) summarizes the events regarding the breach and the steps taken by the company to assess, respond to, and recover from the incident and (2) describes the actions that federal customers and oversight agencies took in response to the breach. GAO reviewed relevant federal laws and regulations, and interviewed agency officials. What GAO Found In March 2017, unidentified individuals discovered a known vulnerability in software running on Equifax's online dispute portal that could be used to obtain access to the system. In May of that year, attackers exploited the vulnerability and began to extract data containing personally identifiable information (PII) from Equifax's information systems. According to Equifax, the attackers used a number of techniques to disguise their exploit of the Equifax systems and the database queries they conducted. On July 29, 2017, Equifax discovered the breach and reported that it took actions to address the factors that allowed the attackers to successfully gain access to its network. Further, the company reported that it took steps to identify, notify, and provide support to individuals who were potentially impacted by the breach. After the breach, federal customer agencies took a variety of actions based on their responsibilities and how the breach affected their operations. Specifically, the agencies that were customers of the company's services conducted independent assessments of the company's security controls, revised their own identity proofing processes, and made changes to their contracts with Equifax, among other activities. Equifax did not ask the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), which is the central agency that responds to cyber incidents across the federal government, to assist in responding to the breach. Nevertheless, the department took the step of reminding federal agencies of the importance of correcting the software vulnerability that led to the breach. In addition, the oversight agencies, the Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection (BCFP), and the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), began taking actions to investigate the breach and inform the public.",

DOD has struggled to deliver software-intensive systems that meet operational requirements within expected time frames. GAO was asked to review software-intensive DOD space systems. This report addresses, for selected software-intensive programs, (1) the extent to which these programs have involved users and delivered software using newer development approaches; and (2) what software-specific management challenges, if any, these programs have faced. GAO reviewed relevant DOD policies, guidance, and other documents; analyzed software development documentation; and interviewed DOD officials and contractors. What GAO Found The Department of Defense (DOD) has struggled to deliver software-intensive space programs that meet operational requirements within expected time frames. Although user involvement is critical to the success of any software development effort, key programs often did not effectively involve users early or continually during development, base user feedback on actual working software, or incorporate user feedback into subsequent software deliveries. Most programs had plans to incorporate these elements of user engagement throughout their software development efforts, but they often did not follow those plans due, in part, to the lack of specific guidance on user involvement and feedback. Regarding frequency of software delivery, while DODI 5000.02 suggests that programs deliver incremental software deliveries every 1 to 2 years, the programs GAO reviewed often continued to deliver software consistent with the long delivery schedules common to waterfall development. DOD is taking steps to address this issue. Selected programs have had software-specific management challenges, but DOD is taking steps to address them. For example, three of the programs GAO reviewed had difficulty integrating and maintaining modified commercial software during development. For example, the Joint Space Operations Center (JSpOC) program underestimated the level of effort to modify commercial software, which increased cost and introduced schedule delays. The MUOS program underestimated the level of effort to modify commercial software, which increased cost and introduced schedule delays. The Air Force's Next Generation Operational Control System (OCX) program underestimated the level of effort to modify commercial software, which increased cost and introduced schedule delays.

In 2015, GAO reported that IRS faced challenges in identifying and mitigating the risks associated with its identity-based tax systems. This testimony discusses (1) IRS's efforts to address its authentication challenges and (2) additional actions that IRS could take to strengthen security and stay ahead of fraudsters. This statement is based on GAO's report, IRS: Efforts to Address Authentication Challenges and Address Opportunities for Future Investment (GAO-06-282). GAO reviewed IRS documents and interviewed IRS officials and industry representatives. What GAO Found The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) has established organizational structures essential to supporting its taxpayer authentication efforts. Specifically, IRS created an Identity Assurance Office in 2015 to work with stakeholders across IRS to review and assess the agency's various authentication programs and efforts. In 2016, IAO led an effort that identified over 100 interactions between IRS and taxpayers that require authentication and categorized these interactions based on potential risks to the agency and taxpayers. Further, in December 2016, IAO released its Roadmap for developing a modern and secure authentication environment for all taxpayers regardless of how they interact with IRS\u2014online, over the telephone, in person, or via correspondence. IRS has begun to implement its authentication strategy, but has not prioritized the initiatives supporting its strategy nor identified the resources required to complete them, consistent with program management leading practices. For example, one of IRS's foundational initiatives is to send event-driven notifications to taxpayers, such as when they file a return or request a tax transcript.

VA's health care system is organized into entities at the headquarters, regional, and local levels. VA's pharmacy system is responsible for supporting VAMCs with a broad range of pharmacy services, such as promoting appropriate drug therapy, ensuring medication safety, providing clinical guidance to pharmacists and other clinicians, and maintaining VA's formulary of medications and supplies VAMCs use to deliver pharmacy benefits. GAO was asked to review VAMC pharmacy inventory management. This report examines (1) the approaches VAMCs have taken to manage their pharmacy inventories and (2) the extent to which VA's oversight of VAMC pharmacy inventory management is limited. GAO reviewed VA policies and procedures, interviewed VA officials, and visited five VAMCs selected based on geographic location and pharmacy inventory management. What GAO Found The Department of Veterans Affairs' (VA) five VAMCs GAO reviewed have generally similar approaches for managing their pharmacy inventories, with some unique approaches in implementing two steps of the pharmacy inventory management process: procuring medications from vendors or other suppliers, receiving and storing these medications, tracking medications to account for all items and prevent diversion, dispensing medications to patients, and disposing of expired medications. GAO found that while the five selected VAMCs have similar approaches for receiving and storing, dispensing, and disposing of medications, some VAMCs have also taken unique approaches in implementing two steps of the pharmacy inventory management process: procurement and tracking. VA policy outlines parameters for VAMCs to manage their pharmacy inventories, and VA officials told GAO that VAMC pharmacy staff can use discretion to implement their own approaches for managing their pharmacy inventories. VA does not yet have a VA-wide pharmacy inventory management system in place that would allow it to monitor VAMC pharmacy inventory in real time and provide better oversight of how VAMC pharmacies manage their inventories. GAO found that VA's Office of the Undersecretary for Health (PBM) and five Veterans Integrated Service Networks (VISN) provide some limited oversight related to VAMC pharmacy inventory management, but no entity has system-wide responsibility for overseeing system-wide performance of VAMC pharmacies in managing their inventories. Instead, responsibility for overseeing pharmacy inventory management is largely delegate",

In 1982, CSPF was subject to a federal court-enforceable consent decree that gave CSPF the authority to set and change its investment policy and to set and execute its investment returns. GAO was asked to review CSPF. This report examines (1) what is known about the factors that contributed to CSPF's critical financial condition; (2) what has been CSPF's investment policy, and the process for setting and executing it, since the consent decree was established; and (3) how CSPF performed over time, particularly compared to similar pension plans. GAO reviewed relevant federal laws and regulations, literature, and documentation, and interviewed federal agency officials and other stakeholders. What GAO Found The Central States, Southeast and Southwest Areas Pension Fund (CSPF) has been underfunded since the consent decree was established in 1982. CSPF's unfunded liability increased by approximately $11.2 billion (in inflation-adjusted dollars) between January 1983 and January 2016. As a consequence, participant benefits were never fully secured by plan assets over this period, as measured by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA). Stakeholders identified several factors that contributed to CSPF's critical financial condition and reflect the challenges faced by many multiemployer plans. For example, many multiemployer plans have experienced financial difficulties due to a combination of investment losses and insufficient employer contributions. In addition to being underfunded prior to the consent decree going into effect, stakeholders identified other specific factors that contributed to CSPF's critical financial condition, such as trends within the national trucking industry and its workforce, funding challenges and common investment practices of multiemployer plans, and the impact of market downturns on long-term investment performance. Stakeholders also described the effects of the 2007 withdrawal of a key employer, United Parcel Service (UPS), on CSPF's critical financial condition. CSPF's investment policy has generally increased its allocation to equities, but shifted toward fixed income in 2017, ahead of projected insolvency. CSPF's investment returns in recent decades have generally been in line with the annual returns of a customized peer group of large institutional funds.

FCC has identified increasing access to affordable broadband as a long-term strategic goal. In 2018, Congress directed FCC to develop a report evaluating broadband coverage in certain tribal lands and to complete a proceeding to address unserved areas by September 23, 2020. FCC collects and uses data that capture broadband availability to measure broadband access on tribal lands, leading to overstatements of broadband access on tribal lands. GAO was asked to review FCC's approach to collecting broadband availability data. This report discusses the extent to which (1) FCC's approach to collecting broadband availability data accurately captures the ability of Americans living on tribal lands to access broadband Internet services and (2) FCC obtains tribal input on the accuracy of provider-submitted broadband data for tribal lands. GAO analyzed FCC's data and FCC's guidance and documents, and interviewed FCC officials and industry stakeholders. What GAO Found The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) collects and uses data that capture broadband availability to measure broadband access on tribal lands, leading to overstatements of broadband access on tribal lands. FCC's method of collecting mobile and fixed broadband data from providers (the Form 477) does not accurately or completely capture broadband access on tribal lands because it (1) captures nationwide broadband availability data\u2014areas where providers may have broadband infrastructure\u2014but does so in a way that leads to overstatements of availability, and (2) does not capture information on factors that FCC and tribal stakeholders have stated can affect broadband access on tribal lands, such as affordability, service quality, and denials of service. Nonetheless, FCC uses its Form 477 broadband availability data in annual broadband deployment reports to measure the percentage of Americans living on tribal lands with or without access to broadband, and to measure progress toward FCC's strategic goal of increasing all Americans' access to affordable broadband. By using broadband availability data to measure broadband access on tribal lands, FCC overstates broadband access on tribal lands.

Nearly 1.8 million (over 14 percent) attended schools where at least three-quarters of the students were experiencing poverty. GAO was asked to review the college preparation opportunities available to students in high-poverty schools. This report examines (1) the extent to which high schools of different poverty levels offer courses to prepare students academically for college and (2) describes challenges that students in high-poverty schools face in being prepared to attend college. GAO analyzed federal data on college preparatory course offerings by school poverty level quartiles; and within these quartiles, GAO analyzed student demographics and course offerings by school type, size, and locale. GAO also interviewed officials from state educational agencies, school districts, college advising organizations, and public 4-year colleges. GAO selected three states\u2014California, Georgia, and Wisconsin\u2014based on the percentage of students eligible for free or reduced-priced lunch and the number of courses offered by schools in each state. GAO also interviewed officials from state educational agencies, school districts, college advising organizations, and public 4-year colleges. What GAO Found High-poverty schools offer fewer of the courses that prepare students for public 4-year college at a glace: Students' access to more advanced high school courses decreased as the level of school poverty increased. High-poverty schools represented 17 percent of all high schools in 2015-16. College admissions officials from all four public, 4-year universities GAO interviewed reported that they look for students to take advanced courses in high school in order to be more competitive applicants. However, GAO's analysis of Education's school year 2015-16 data found that some high-poverty schools may not offer the math and science courses needed to meet basic admission expectations for public 4-year colleges. For example, an estimated 95 percent of colleges expected applicants to have completed three or four credits of math, but GAO found that the percentage of schools offering these recommended courses decreased as poverty level increased. Officials from all 12 high-poverty schools GAO visited consistently reported that students confront multiple challenges to being prepared to attend college, including that students are behind academically before they get to high school; that the schools they attend lack rigorous courses, such as Advanced Placement",

HHS-OIG has used this authority to negotiate agreements with entities that pose the highest risk of potential fraud. GAO was asked to review HHS-OIG's use of this authority. This report examines (1) the number and types of agreements HHS-OIG entered into from July 2005 through July 2017, and (2) the extent to which HHS-OIG uses its permissive exclusion authority to ensure compliance with agreements and to exclude entities for noncompliance. GAO analyzed HHS-OIG data from July 2005 through July 2017, reviewed HHS-OIG documents, and interviewed HHS-OIG officials. What GAO Found From July 2005 through July 2017, the Department of Health and Human Services' (HHS) Office of Inspector General (HHS-OIG) entered into 652 new agreements\u2014an average of about 50 agreements per year\u2014ranging from a high of 83 to a low of 37. The agreements were almost exclusively agreements with large corporations, and agreements with individual practitioners and entities such as small physician groups. HHS-OIG has used these agreements exclusively since 2010. From 2010 to July 2017, 74 percent of agreements have been agreements with larger corporations and 26 percent have been agreements with individual practitioners and entities such as small physician groups. HHS-OIG entered into agreements with a wide range of entities, but most were concentrated among a few types of entities. Specifically, HHS-OIG entered into agreements with 30 different types of entities, though slightly more than half of the agreements were with 3 types\u2014individual/small group practices, hospitals, and skilled nursing facilities. Another quarter of the agreements were with medical group practices, pharmaceutical manufacturers, clinics, medical device manufacturers, and ambulance companies. HHS-OIG has criteria to determine whether to exercise its permissive exclusion authority, or take an alternate action, such as entering into an agreement with an entity. HHS-OIG has four broad categories of criteria that it applies in deciding where an entity falls on the risk continuum and which action to take. These four categories are (1) the nature and circumstances of the conduct; (2) conduct during the government's investigation; (3) whether the entity has made efforts to improve its conduct; and (4) the entity's history of compliance.

    "gao_GAO-18-373T": "Why GAO Did This Study The Consolidated Natural Resources Act of 2008 amended the U.S.-CNMI covenant to apply federal immigration law to the CNMI after a transition period. To provide for an orderly transition from the CNMI immigration system to the U.S. federal immigration system under the immigration laws of the United States, DHS established the CW program in 2011. Under the program, foreign workers are able to obtain, through their employers, nonimmigrant CW-1 status that allows them to work in the CNMI for up to a year. The Consolidated Natural Resources Act of 2008 required DHS to annually reduce the number of CW-1 permits until the number reaches zero by the end of the transition period. The act was further amended in August 2017 to, among other things, (1) add 350 CW-1 permits to the fiscal year 2017 cap; (2) restrict future permits for workers in construction and extraction occupations; and (3) increase the CNMI education funding fee that employers must pay for each permit from $150 to $200. This testimony is based on GAO's ongoing work on the CW program and the CNMI economy. It is based on preliminary observations from GAO's ongoing work on the CW program and the CNMI economy. GAO's preliminary analysis of DHS CW-1 permit data for fiscal years 2012 through 2018 identified trends in CW-1 workers' country of birth, occupation, and duration of employment. GAO's preliminary analysis indicates that the number of approved CW-1 permits grew from 7,127 in fiscal year 2012 to more than 13,000 in fiscal year 2016. On October 14, 2016, 2 weeks into fiscal year 2017, the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) announced that it had received enough petitions to reach the CW-1 cap for fiscal year 2017 and would not accept requests for new permits for that year during the remaining 11 months. In May 2017, USCIS announced that it had received a sufficient number of petitions to reach the CW-1 cap for fiscal year 2018. This testimony is based on GAO's ongoing work on the CW program and the CNMI economy. GAO's preliminary analysis of USCIS CW-1 permit data for fiscal years 2012 through 2018 identified trends in CW-1 workers' country of birth, occupation, and duration of employment.

    "gao_GAO-18-71": "Why GAO Did This Study The United States is the world's largest consumer and commercial market for wireless devices. The demand for spectrum is expected to grow as companies bring new IoT technologies and services to market and government users. GAO was asked to examine the challenges facing federal spectrum managers and the steps they are taking to address those challenges. This report examines (1) the spectrum-related challenges stakeholders identified due to the anticipated growth of IoT, (2) steps FCC and NTIA are taking to plan for the anticipated growth in the demand for spectrum as a result of IoT, and (3) efforts that selected leading countries are undertaking to plan for IoT's spectrum needs and ways that these efforts compare with those of the United States. GAO reviewed relevant literature and interviewed officials from FCC and NTIA, and representatives from selected leading countries. GAO also surveyed trade journals, industry groups, and foreign governments' websites and publications. What GAO Found Stakeholders representing Internet-connected devices (IoT) network providers, device manufacturers, users, and federal regulators consistently identified two spectrum-related challenges to the continued growth and development of IoT: (1) ensuring the availability of sufficient spectrum and (2) managing the harmful interference from the increasing number of IoT devices. While not currently a crisis, the stakeholders GAO spoke to agreed that ensuring the availability of sufficient spectrum and the right kinds of spectrum is a key challenge for supporting the growth of IoT. Specifically, stakeholders cited three dimensions of the spectrum availability challenge: the amount, the balance between licensed and unlicensed, and the variety of spectrum bands available. According to some reports, incorrectly anticipating industry needs in any of these areas could weaken IoT growth and development in the United States. To plan for spectrum needs, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) has repurposed spectrum by making additional spectrum available for commercial purposes and, according to FCC officials, the agency is continuing to look for additional opportunities to do so. For example, in 2016, FCC issued a final order that opened up high-band spectrum (above 24 GHz) for use with 5G networks and applications. This order follows a technology neutral approach to planning by allowing spectrum users to develop technologies for the spectrum and not have FCC dictate its specific use. FCC officials said that the agency tracks industry-produced trends and projections related to spectrum demand and use but",
    "gao_GAO-18-187T": "Why GAO Did This Study The 2012 National Infrastructure Protection and Resiliency Act required the National Science Foundation (NIST) to establish a network to provide public safety information. The act also required that FirstNet develop a framework to meet the financial requirements established in the act. This testimony discusses (1) FirstNet's progress in establishing and financing the network and consulting stakeholders, and (2) FirstNet's network reliability, security, and interoperability challenges and efforts to address them. This statement is based on GAO's June 2017 report, Public Safety Network: FirstNet's Progress in Establishing and Financing the Network and Consulting Stakeholders (GAO-17-283) and selected updates conducted in September 2017. GAO reviewed relevant laws, regulations, and guidance; interviewed federal, state, and tribal officials; and analyzed FirstNet documents and interviewed stakeholders. What GAO Found In its June 2017 report, GAO found that FirstNet has conducted key efforts to establish the network, namely releasing the request for proposal for the network in January 2016 and awarding the network contract to AT&T in March 2017. As the contractor, AT&T will be responsible for the overall design, development, production, operation, and evolution of the network, as well as the marketing, product management, sales, distribution, and customer care. Further, GAO found that FirstNet has established a framework to meet the financial requirements established in the 2012 Act. This framework focuses on leveraging FirstNet's spectrum through the use of payments and fees with the aim of ensuring that the network is financially sustainable over the life of the contract and that FirstNet sustains self-funding operations. By establishing a single, dedicated network for public safety use, FirstNet's network is expected to foster greater interoperability and meet public safety officials' reliability and other needs. However, the actual use (or \"adoption\") of the network by public safety users will be voluntary. Thus, even with the establishment of this framework, substantial unknowns remain regarding how many public safety users will adopt the network, the extent to which AT&T will be successful in monetizing the spectrum to retain revenue from commercial users, and the extent to which this revenue will be sufficient or appropriate in relation to the capital needed to build, operate, and maintain the network. Therefore, GAO noted that, at the time of GAO's report, GAO could not",

The act also provided an additional $9.4 billion for the Veterans Choice Fund. The act also included a provision for GAO to review VA's implementation of the Choice Program. This report examines (1) the extent to which VA's TPAs have taken steps to pay claims from community providers under the Choice Program and (2) the extent to which VA has addressed key factors affecting the timeliness of claim payments to community providers under the Choice Program. GAO reviewed VA's contract with two TPAs that administer the Veterans Choice Fund\u2014Health Net and TriWest\u2014and interviewed VA and TPA officials. What GAO Found The Department of Veterans Affairs' (VA) two TPAs\u2014Health Net and TriWest\u2014have taken steps to pay claims from community providers under the Veterans Choice Fund, which is a temporary program that provides health care services to eligible veterans. From November 2014 through June 2018, VA's TPAs paid a total of about 16 million clean claims\u2014claims that contain all required data elements\u2014under the Choice Program, of which TriWest paid about 9.6 million claims and Health Net paid about 6.4 million. Data on the median number of days VA's TPAs have taken to pay clean claims show wide variation over the course of the Choice Program\u2014from 7 days to 68 days. VA and its TPAs identified three key factors affecting the timeliness of claim payments to community providers under the Choice Program: (1) VA's untimely payments of TPA invoices; (2) Choice Program contractual requirements related to provider reimbursement; and (3) inadequate provider education on filing Choice Program claims. VA and its TPAs identified three key factors affecting the timeliness of claim payments to community providers under the Choice Program: (1) VA's untimely payments of TPA invoices; (2) Choice Program contractual requirements related to provider reimbursement; and (3) inadequate provider education on filing Choice Program claims. VA was unable to monitor the timeliness of its TPAs' payments to community providers because it did not require the TPAs to provide data on the length of time taken to pay these claims.

    "gao_GAO-18-39": "Why GAO Did This Study The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) estimates that taxpayers should have paid an average of about $2.5 trillion dollars per year in federal taxes for tax years 2008 to 2010. IRS also estimates that taxpayers paid approximately $2.04 trillion voluntarily and on time for those years, on average, leaving $458 billion in unpaid taxes per year. However, IRS estimates that through late payments and enforcement actions it eventually will collect an additional $52 billion on average for those years, leaving the average net tax gap at $406 billion for 2008 to 2010. GAO was asked to review IRS's efforts to address the tax gap. This report (1) determines the main drivers of the tax gap; (2) IRS's confidence in the tax gap estimates; (3) IRS goals, if any, for reducing the tax gap; and (4) the extent to which IRS uses tax gap estimates and underlying data to develop strategies and actions to reduce the tax gap. GAO reviewed IRS's tax gap estimates and underlying data; reviewed IRS and Treasury documents; and interviewed IRS officials. What GAO Found Underreporting of tax liabilities accounted for most of the tax gap estimate for tax years 2008\u20132010, making up 84 percent of the entire estimated gross tax gap. Individual income taxes made up the largest portion of underreporting, followed by employment taxes and corporation income taxes. IRS has confidence in most aspects of the tax gap estimate and is taking steps to improve it. IRS officials stated that the tax gap estimates are sufficiently reliable for the intended purpose of providing a snapshot of tax compliance as a whole. However, IRS recognizes that some component estimates of the tax gap estimate are more uncertain than others, in part because some component estimates rely on older data and it is inherently difficult to estimate some types of noncompliance. IRS has broad goals for improving voluntary compliance, but lacks specific quantitative goals for increasing voluntary compliance. IRS previously set or acknowledged quantitative goals to improve voluntary compliance. However, IRS has since moved away from that approach. In 2005, GAO recommended that IRS establish a long-term quantitative voluntary compliance goal for individual income tax underreporting and for tax underpayment, as well as for other areas of noncompliance. IRS agreed with the concept of GAO's recommendation and, in response, established a voluntary compliance rate goal of 85 percent by 2009, which was published in IRS's fiscal year 2007 budget request. IRS has since",
    "gao_GAO-18-164": "Why GAO Did This Study The Departments of Labor (DOL), Justice (DOJ), and Health and Human Services (HHS) have a long history of requiring grantees to make hiring decisions based on religion. In 2007, the Office of Labor's (OLC) Office of Labor Policy (OLP) issued an opinion that questioned the extent to which DOJ, DOL, and HHS had a religious-based hiring policy. GAO was asked to review DOJ's religious-based hiring policy. This report examines (1) the extent to which DOJ, DOL, and HHS have statutory restrictions on religious-based hiring and (2) how DOJ, DOL, and HHS inform grantees of statutory restrictions on religious-based hiring and processes for obtaining an exemption from such restrictions. GAO reviewed relevant laws and regulations, and interviewed DOJ, DOL, and HHS officials. What GAO Found From 2007 to 2015, DOJ, DOL, and HHS awarded funding to at least 2,586 grantees through at least 53 grant programs that were subject to statutory restrictions on religious-based hiring. Specifically, HHS identified one grant program subject to statutory restrictions on religious-based hiring for which nonprofits were eligible to be primary recipients\u2014the Projects for Assistance in Transition from Homelessness (PATH) program, which is administered by the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA). Generally, only states are eligible to be primary recipients for PATH grant awards. However, HHS may award PATH grants directly to public or nonprofit entities if a state does not submit an application or does not meet program requirements. From these programs, no grants were awarded to nonprofit organizations and therefore no FBOs were awarded grants. DOJ identified at least 34 relevant grant programs administered by OVW, COPS, and six different program offices within OJP that were subject to statutory restrictions on religious-based hiring. From these 18 programs, 931 grantees were awarded grants, including 19 GAO identified as potential FBOs. Of the 117 potential FBOs GAO identified across the three agencies, 9 faith-based grantees, all of which were awarded DOJ grants, certified that they were exempt from statutory restrictions on religious-based hiring.

EPA has a government-to-government relationship with Indian tribes, and the federal government also has a trust responsibility to Indian tribes and their members based on treaties, federal laws, and court decisions. EPA consults with Indian tribes in certain circumstances regarding cleanup actions at Superfund sites. GAO was asked to review EPA's consultation with Indian tribes. This report examines (1) the extent to which EPA has reliable data on the sites that are located on tribal property or that affect tribes, and (2) the extent to which EPA has reliable data on the agency's consultation with tribes regarding Superfund sites. GAO reviewed EPA data and documents, and interviewed EPA officials in headquarters and 10 regional offices. GAO also reviewed relevant laws and policies and interviewed officials from EPA and Indian tribes. What GAO Found The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) does not have reliable data on the sites that are located on tribal property or that affect tribes. Specifically, EPA data identifying sites that are on tribal property are not accurate or complete based on GAO's reviews of agency data and interviews with EPA officials. EPA officials told GAO that some site location information was inaccurately transposed during maintenance of the former database of record used prior to adopting the Superfund Enterprise Management System (SEMS), and that these errors, in some cases, carried over to SEMS. EPA officials told GAO that the agency's data regarding NPL sites on tribal property may not be accurate and provided explanations for why these data are unreliable. EPA officials told GAO that they review the on tribal property data periodically outside of these reports; however, EPA currently lacks a regular review process for these data. EPA data identifying which sites have known Native American Interest (NAI) are inaccurate and incomplete, based on GAO's reviews of agency data and interviews with EPA officials. For example, GAO found nine sites with NAI that EPA did not identify as having NAI. EPA officials also inconsistently used the NAI variable in SEMS when there was no longer tribal interest in a site. EPA officials told GAO that identifying NAI can be complicated by the fact that tribes may have interest in sites not",

The site is also responsible for executing the B83 strategic nuclear bomb, which is expected to expire in 2022. The Senate committee report accompanying a bill for the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2018 included a provision for GAO to review the Kansas City site's staffing plans and capabilities to meet national security requirements. This report examines (1) workload forecasts for the Kansas City site since 2012, and (2) management challenges the Kansas City site has identified for achieving the forecasted workload and actions the site has taken to mitigate these challenges. GAO reviewed workload forecasts and management documents, and interviewed NNSA and contractor officials at the Kansas City site. What GAO Found Projected workload for the Kansas City site has increased significantly from 2012\u2014when the site was built\u2014to the 2018 stockpile plan update. Specifically, the Kansas City site's production schedule for the B61-12 Life Extension Program (LEP) and W88 Alteration (Alt) 370 weapons systems has been delayed by approximately 2 years, and their completions have been delayed by 3 years from initial schedule estimates in 2012. The 2018 plan also accelerates production of the W80-4 LEP by approximately 5 years. Using an enterprise risk management approach, the Kansas City site determined that this change in production schedule represented a significant challenge that needed to be better understood and regularly monitored. NNSA officials and contractor representatives at the Kansas City site have identified and begun to mitigate several management challenges to meeting the forecasted workload for known future production requirements, but they face uncertainties about future workload demands. Specifically, current mitigation efforts should help the site meet currently forecasted increased workload and capacity demands, according to NNSA analysis and consistent with the program plan included in the Fiscal Year 2018 Stockpile Stewardship and Management Plan. However, the February 2018 Nuclear Posture Review, the results of which were not fully reflected in the Fiscal Year 2018 Stockpile Stewardship and Management Plan, may change requirements and add to the site's workload because it calls for additional weapons efforts.

The exchanges are also a source of health insurance for certain consumers. The exchanges are also a source of health insurance for certain individuals and families. GAO was asked to review the exchanges' enrollment process. This report examines (1) trends in the premiums for selected consumer groups and (2) the extent to which consumers are automatically re-enrolled into exchange plans. GAO analyzed data from the exchanges from 2015 to 2017 on the premiums for selected consumer groups and the extent to which consumers were automatically re-enrolled into exchange plans. GAO also analyzed data from the federal exchanges from 2015 to 2016 on the premiums for selected consumer groups and the extent to which consumers were automatically re-enrolled into exchange plans. GAO also reviewed relevant literature and interviewed officials from the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS), the federal agency that administers the exchanges, and the American Association of Securities and Exchanges (ASPE). What GAO Found From 2015 to 2017, most of the nearly 2,600 counties included in GAO's analysis of the premiums for selected consumer groups changed and premiums generally increased. In most of the nearly 2,600 counties included in GAO's analysis, the plan that GAO identified as the benchmark plan changed from 2015 to 2017. For example, in 85 percent of the counties included in GAO's analysis, the 2015 benchmark plan was not benchmark plans in either 2016 or 2017, the other 2 years GAO studied. The benchmark plan was the same plan in all 3 years in only 3 percent of the counties. In addition, the median change in monthly premiums for the benchmark plans was an increase of 11 percent from 2015 to 2016, and 28 percent 2016 to 2017. In contrast, although not particularly common, relatively stable or even decreasing premiums from year to year were more likely from 2015 to 2016 than from 2016 to 2017. GAO found that in many counties, the implications for automatically re-enrolled consumers were modest because net premiums\u2014after accounting for tax credits for those eligible for those credits\u2014were limited. Thirty percent of consumers who were enrolled in plans through the federal exchange in both 2015 and 2016, 30 percent were automatically re-enrolled. Of those consumers who were automatically",

The National Cancer Institute estimates that cancer risks from low-dose radiation are about one-third of the cancer risk. The National Academy of Sciences, the National Academies, and other federal agencies have funded research on the health effects of low-dose radiation. This testimony discusses (1) how selected federal agencies have developed and applied radiation protection requirements and guidance for workers and the public, (2) the extent to which federal agencies have funded research on the health effects of low-dose radiation, and (3) the extent to which federal agencies have collaborated on research on the health effects of low-dose radiation. This statement is based on GAO's September 2017 report on low-dose radiation health effects (GAO-17-92). GAO reviewed relevant federal laws, regulations, and agency documents and interviewed agency officials. What GAO Found The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC), Department of Energy (DOE), and Food and Drug Administration (FDA) have generally taken the advice of scientific advisory bodies to develop and apply radiation protection requirements and guidance for workers and the public. In particular, they have relied on the advice of the International Commission on Radiological Protection, the National Council on Radiation Protection and Measurements, and the National Academies' Nuclear and Radiation Studies Board. This advice includes the use of the linear no-threshold model, which assumes that the risk of cancer increases with every incremental increase in radiation exposure. For example, the National Academies published a report in 2006 stating that the balance of evidence from various types of studies tends to favor a simple proportionate relationship between radiation at low doses and cancer risk. The advisory bodies have recognized challenges in accurately estimating cancer risks from very low doses of radiation exposure when using the linear no-threshold model. Nevertheless, NRC officials told GAO that, in the absence of convincing evidence that there is a dose threshold below which low levels of radiation are beneficial or not harmful, NRC will continue to follow the recommendations of scientific advisory bodies to use the linear no-threshold model. Similarly, officials from EPA told GAO that they would consider changing the use of the linear no-threshold model as the basis of their requirements and guidance only if there were a strong recommendation from scientific advisory bodies on radiation protection as well as an",

In 2017, two major hurricanes (Irma and Maria) hit Puerto Rico. The National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2018 included a provision for GAO to review the HUBZone program. This report (1) examines SBA's development of criteria and guidance on using a risk-based approach for certifying and recertifying Historically Underutilized Business Zone (HUBZone) firms, (2) examines SBA's implementation of the revised policies and procedures for firms located in Puerto Rico, and (3) describes any economic impacts of HUBZone expansion and recent trends in federal small business contracting in Puerto Rico. GAO reviewed SBA's policies and procedures for certifying and monitoring HUBZone firms and interviewed agency officials in Washington, D.C., and Puerto Rico. What GAO Found The Small Business Administration (SBA) adopted criteria and guidance for certifying and recertifying HUBZone firms in March 2017, but the extent to which it conducted a risk assessment of the recertification process is unclear. SBA's internal guidance directs staff to review and confirm the accuracy of all documentation provided by the firms applying for HUBZone certification. However, the 2017 guidance and criteria introduced some documentation requirements to the recertification process. (Before March 2017, firms seeking HUBZone recertification were not required to submit documentation to demonstrate continued compliance with eligibility requirements.) Currently, any certified firm seeking recertification that received $1 million or more in HUBZone contract dollars since its last certification or recertification has to demonstrate compliance with 35 percent employee residency and principal office requirements. SBA officials stated that out of necessity, given their current information system and staffing resources, they chose the $1 million threshold as the only criterion for their risk-based approach. SBA officials stated that they plan to review the current threshold at the end of fiscal year 2018 and that the threshold amount will likely decrease because a relatively small number of firms have exceeded the $1 million threshold. SBA did not consistently document or follow its policies and procedures for certification reviews for firms in Puerto Rico that GAO reviewed. For 9 of 12",

MDA has flexibilities to set requirements and manage the acquisition of the BMDS, which allow MDA to expedite the fielding of assets and integrated capabilities. GAO was asked to review MDA's acquisition of the BMDS. This report examines MDA's progress in (1) delivering assets and integrated capabilities, and (2) ensuring that models and simulations are accredited for operational testing of the BMDS. GAO reviewed MDA's acquisition policies and procedures, and interviewed MDA officials. What GAO Found The Missile Defense Agency (MDA) made some progress delivering assets and integrated capabilities, but did not meet many of its acquisition goals as expressed in the Ballistic Missile Defense System Accountability Report for fiscal year 2017, its integrated master test plan, and master integration plan. Specifically, MDA continued to deliver interceptors for three elements and successfully conducted its first test against an intercontinental ballistic missile target. In addition, MDA announced the delivery of one package of integrated BMDS-level capabilities through a technical capability declaration (TCD), which had been delayed from the previous year, and planned to complete the delivery of another set of capabilities by March 2018. MDA, however, did not complete its goals for delivering assets, specifically for the THAAD interceptors or conducting planned testing for Aegis Ballistic Missile Defense (BMD). GAO also identified several deficiencies in MDA's processes for communicating progress in delivering integrated capabilities. Specifically, MDA's process for managing the delivery of integrated capabilities is not applied consistently and has unclear requirements. For example, MDA's process for defining requirements for a TCD does not clearly specify the exact requirements, process, and key milestones necessary to issue a TCD. Moreover, MDA's use of undefinitized contract actions, which authorizes a contractor to begin work before contract terms, specifications, or price have been agreed upon, poses cost and schedule risks to the government. MDA entered into 11 undefinitized contract actions in fiscal year 2017, and the average time to definitize these contract actions has steadily increased.

The 340B Program also includes a provision for GAO to review HRSA's oversight of the 340B Program. This statement discusses (1) the extent to which selected covered entities have contract pharmacies, and the characteristics of their contract pharmacies; (2) HRSA's oversight of the 340B Program; and (3) HRSA's oversight of the 340B Program. This statement is based on GAO's June 2018 report, 340B: Oversight Impedes HRSA's Ability to Ensure Compliance at Contract Pharmacies (GAO-2018-06-282). GAO reviewed HRSA data on covered entities' contract pharmacy arrangements and interviewed HRSA officials. GAO also reviewed HRSA audits of covered entities and interviewed HRSA officials. What GAO Found GAO found that as of July 1, 2017, about one-third of the more than 12,000 covered entities in the 340B Program had contract pharmacies. A higher percentage of hospitals (69.3 percent) had at least one contract pharmacy compared to federal grantees (22.8 percent). Among covered entities that had at least one contract pharmacy, the number of contract pharmacies ranged from 1 to 439, with an average of 12 contract pharmacies per entity. The distance between the entities and their contract pharmacies ranged from 0 miles (meaning that the contract pharmacy and entity were co-located) to more than 5,000 miles; the median distance was 4.2 miles. About half of the 55 covered entities responding to GAO's questionnaire reported providing low-income, uninsured patients discounts on 340B drugs at some or all of their contract pharmacies. Federal grantees were more likely than hospitals to provide patients with discounts on the price of drugs and to provide them at all contract pharmacies. Of the 30 covered entities that provided discounts, 23 indicated that they pass on the full 340B discount to patients, resulting in patients paying the 340B price or less for drugs. In many cases, these covered entities indicated that patients received drugs at no cost. GAO found weaknesses in HRSA's oversight that impede its ability to ensure compliance with 340B Program requirements at contract pharmacies. Specifically, GAO found that HRSA does not have complete",
    "gao_GAO-18-260T": "Why GAO Did This Study This testimony discusses the extent to which VA medical centers have documented and conducted reviews of providers' clinical care after concerns have been raised about their care. GAO was asked to review VA medical centers' oversight of providers' clinical care. This statement is based on GAO's report, Veterans Health: VA Medical Centers Need to Report Providers to the NPDB and to State Licensing Boards as Required (GAO-17-45). GAO reviewed VHA policy, interviewed VA medical center officials, and reviewed documentation from five VA medical centers selected based on geographic diversity and other factors. GAO also reviewed relevant laws and regulations and interviewed VA medical center officials. What GAO Found GAO found that from October 2013 through March 2017, the five selected Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) medical centers required reviews of a total of 148 providers' clinical care after concerns were raised about their care, but officials at these medical centers could not provide documentation to show that almost half of these reviews were conducted. GAO found that all five VA medical centers lacked at least some documentation of the reviews they told GAO they conducted, and in some cases, GAO found that the required reviews were not conducted at all. Specifically, GAO found that all five VA medical centers lacked documentation showing that one type of review\u2014focused professional practice evaluations (FPPE) for cause\u2014had been conducted for 26 providers after concerns had been raised about their care. FPPEs for cause are reviews of providers' care over a specified period of time, during which the provider continues to see patients and has the opportunity to demonstrate improvement. GAO also found that the five VA medical centers did not always conduct reviews of providers' clinical care in a timely manner. Specifically, of the 148 providers, the VA medical centers did not initiate reviews of 16 providers for 3 months, and in some cases, for multiple years, after concerns had been raised about the providers' care. In a few of these cases, additional concerns about the providers' clinical care were raised before the reviews began. GAO found that two factors were largely responsible for the inadequate documentation and untimely reviews of providers' clinical care GAO identified at the selected VA medical centers. First, VHA policy does not require VA medical centers to document all types of reviews of providers' clinical care, including retrospective reviews, and VHA has not established a timeliness",

The Army and the Air Force have validated the dental clinic staffing models that they use, and the Navy's draft model is under review. In the absence of a validated model, the Navy uses a general ratio to staff its dental clinics. The Army, the Navy, and the Air Force have not collaborated in their approaches to staffing dental clinics, and have not developed cross-service staffing standards for dental clinic staffing. As DOD progresses in its efforts to implement efficiencies across its Medical Health System and assesses the scope of medical care to be transferred to the Defense Health Agency, it could be of benefit to the dental corps to develop cross-service standards that could result in improvements to the consistency and efficiency of dental clinic staffing. The Army, the Navy, and the Air Force have generally met their recruitment goals for dental students, but generally have not met their recruitment goals for fully qualified dentists to address oral health needs of the services. Overall, GAO found that the services maintained their staffing levels for military dentists during fiscal years 2012 through 2016, but experienced gaps within certain specialties. Further, the services rely on various programs and special pays and incentives, to recruit and retain military dentists, but they do not know the extent to which",

The Coast Guard has a long-term plan to address its backlog of projects, including recapitalizing and replacing its aging infrastructure. GAO was asked to review the Coast Guard's management of its shore infrastructure. This report evaluates (1) what is known about the condition and costs of managing the Coast Guard's shore infrastructure, and (2) the extent to which the Coast Guard's process for managing its shore infrastructure meets leading practices for managing public maintenance backlogs. GAO reviewed Coast Guard documents and data on its shore infrastructure inventory and interviewed Coast Guard officials. What GAO Found As of 2017, the Coast Guard's annual report on shore infrastructure stated that 45 percent of its shore infrastructure assets have exceeded their service lives. The Coast Guard also reported that its overall shore inventory has a 65-year service life. For example, the Coast Guard's 2017 report identified at least 65 percent of aviation pavements, 60 percent of aviation fuel facilities, and at least 53 percent of piers\u2014all of which the Coast Guard has identified as mission-critical assets\u2014as being past their service lives. The Coast Guard's 2017 report also identified at least 65 percent of aviation pavements, 60 percent of aviation fuel facilities, and at least 53 percent of piers\u2014all of which the Coast Guard has identified as mission-critical assets\u2014as being past their service lives. The Coast Guard's process for managing its shore infrastructure does not fully meet 6 of 9 leading practices GAO has previously identified for managing public maintenance backlogs. Specifically, of the nine leading practices, the Coast Guard met three, partially met three, and did not meet three. For example, the Coast Guard partially met three because it has not issued specific guidance on how its facility condition assessments are to be conducted, nor does it follow a standardized or consistent process for conducting these assessments. Without standardized assessments, the Coast Guard's ability to systematically compare projects for prioritization is limited, and this could impact its ability to establish appropriate levels of funding for addressing the backlog. The Coast Guard did not meet 3 of 9 leading practices for managing shore infrastructure backlogs, including establishing clear maintenance and repair investment objectives, employing models for predicting the outcomes of investments and analyzing trade-offs, and structuring budgets and related information",

The Post-Katrina Emergency Communications Reform and Recovery Act of 2007 established 10 RECCWGs to help address emergency communications issues, such as a lack of equipment interoperability. GAO was asked to review the RECCWGs. This report examines (1) the challenges selected stakeholders identified in addressing emergency communications challenges and (2) the extent to which the RECCWGs have enhanced emergency communications capabilities. GAO reviewed relevant laws, regulations, and reports; analyzed the RECCWG annual reports and annual reports; and interviewed officials from FEMA, the Office of Emergency Communications (OEC), and other stakeholders. What GAO Found GAO identified several prevalent challenges to emergency communications based on its analysis of the 10 regional emergency communications coordination groups (RECCWG) and interviews with emergency communications stakeholders. These challenges included achieving the interoperability of communication systems, obtaining funding, ensuring ongoing training, and increasing the emphasis on communications during emergency response exercises. For example, GAO identified a lack of funding for acquiring and maintaining interoperable equipment and systems, as well as for travel and training. Stakeholders identified technical assistance and grants as key challenges to emergency communications. OEC, which provides technical assistance, has delivered more than 2,000 technical-assistance-training courses and workshops since 2007 and has developed other resources, such as a toolkit for managing emergency communications at planned events. FEMA, which provides grants, also provides technical assistance. The RECCWGs have enhanced emergency communications capabilities through relationship building and information sharing\u2014with demonstrated benefits. For example, members have shared information about communications resources within their regions, and have collaborated to provide communications support in responding to Hurricane Harvey. However, collaboration across the regions remains limited. Without ways to collaborate across the regions, RECCWG members may be missing opportunities to share best practices and leverage the experience of their counterparts nationwide.",

DOJ has identified improving debt collection as a major management initiative and has taken steps to improve the collection of restitution. The Justice for All Reauthorization Act of 2016 included a provision for GAO to review DOJ's collection of restitution. This report examines (1) the extent to which DOJ has documented requests for restitution and (2) the extent to which DOJ has identified and recommended practices for requesting, ordering, and collecting restitution. GAO analyzed DOJ data on federal offenders' restitution decisions from fiscal years 2014 through 2016, reviewed DOJ guidance, and interviewed DOJ and USAO officials. What GAO Found The Department of Justice (DOJ) has documented requests for restitution in its case files, but the judiciary did not always document reasons why restitution was not ordered. Specifically, from fiscal years 2014 through 2016, the U.S. Sentencing Commission (USSC) had information on restitution decisions for 95 percent of all offenders. Of the remaining 181,420 offenders, 78 percent were ordered to pay restitution. GAO's analysis of USSC data showed that restitution was not ordered for most offenders sentenced from fiscal years 2014 through 2016. Judges indicated that restitution was not applicable and thus did not order it for most offenders sentenced from fiscal years 2014 through 2016. DOJ collected $2.95 billion in restitution debt from fiscal years 2014 through 2016, half of which was collected on debts imposed during this time period. Of the $2.95 billion in restitution debt collected, about half was collected on debts imposed between fiscal years 1988 and fiscal year 2014. DOJ was more successful at collecting restitution on newer debts\u2014debts imposed during this time period\u2014but most debts remain outstanding due to offenders' inability to pay. USAOs have identified a significant portion of outstanding restitution debt as uncollectible, but they have also identified $10 billion of outstanding restitution debt that could be collected.

This report examines (1) the extent to which NIH has promoted efforts to support early and intermediate stage investigators, and (2) the extent to which NIH has implemented efforts to support investigators from underrepresented groups. GAO analyzed NIH data from fiscal years 2013 through 2017, reviewed relevant laws and regulations, and interviewed NIH officials and stakeholders. What GAO Found The National Institutes of Health (NIH) has promoted efforts to support early and intermediate stage investigators, but those who have not yet received a large NIH research grant remain less competitive. NIH developed certain programs to support extramural investigators beginning their research careers. These programs include both large and smaller research grants, career development grants, and student loan repayments. However, NIH's National Research Initiative (NGRI) policy for fiscal year 2017 directed the NIH institutes and centers to reprioritize large NIH research grants to early stage investigators. However, with only one month to implement the policy, NIH did not meet this goal.

This report examines (1) the extent to which covered entities have contract pharmacies, and the characteristics of those pharmacies; and (2) HRSA's oversight of covered entities' contract pharmacy arrangements. GAO reviewed HRSA data on covered entities' contract pharmacy arrangements and interviewed HRSA officials and representatives from 10 selected covered entities, selected based on their volume of 340B drug purchases, and other factors. GAO also reviewed relevant federal laws and regulations, and interviewed HRSA officials. What GAO Found As of July 1, 2017, about one-third of the more than 12,000 covered entities in the 340B Program had contract pharmacies, but the extent to which covered entities had contract pharmacies varied by type of entity. Overall, a higher percentage of hospitals (69.3 percent) had at least one contract pharmacy compared to federal grantees (22.8 percent). Among the six types of hospitals, the percentage that had at least one contract pharmacy ranged from 39.2 percent of children's hospitals to 74.1 percent of critical access hospitals. Among the 10 types of federal grantees, the percentage with at least one contract pharmacy ranged from 3.9 percent of family planning clinics to 75.2 percent of federally qualified health centers. Among covered entities that had at least 1 contract pharmacy, the number of contract pharmacies ranged from 1 to 439, with an average of 12 contract pharmacies per entity. However, the number of contract pharmacies varied by covered entity type, with disproportionate share hospitals having the most on average (25 contract pharmacies), and critical access hospitals having the least (4 contract pharmacies). Contract pharmacy fees GAO reviewed between selected covered entities and contract pharmacies showed that entities generally agreed to pay their contract pharmacies a flat fee per 340B prescription, with some entities also paying additional fees based on a percentage of revenue generated for each 340B prescription.

This report examines (1) how selected state peer support specialist programs have developed and implemented their programs, and (2) the extent to which selected state peer support specialist programs have developed and implemented leading practices for certifying peer support specialists. GAO reviewed relevant laws, regulations, and guidance; interviewed officials from six states selected based on their size, diversity in population, and other factors; and interviewed 10 stakeholders, including researchers, training or consulting organizations, advocacy organizations, and advocacy organizations. What GAO Found The six states that GAO reviewed generally use the same process for certifying peer support specialists. The six states' programs generally use the same process for certifying peer support specialists. The extent to which each state's program required applicants to meet each of the three stages of certification\u2014screening, training, and certification\u2014varies, and the specifics of each requirement also varied across the six programs. For example, all six programs required applicants to have lived experience in recovery from mental illness, while the amount of experience required varies. The six states also required applicants to complete an initial training, which GAO refers to as \"core training.\" The length, cost, and curricula of these trainings varied across the states, with Georgia and Pennsylvania requiring more than 70 hours of in-person core training and more than 70 hours of in-person core training.

    "gao_GAO-19-47": "Why GAO Did This Study The RFS is designed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by replacing petroleum-based fuels with biofuels that have lower associated greenhouse gas emissions released throughout their lifecycle. The RFS requires blending ethanol with gasoline to demonstrate compliance with the program. GAO was asked to review the RFS. This report examines (1) what is known about the effect that the RFS has had on retail gasoline prices in the United States and (2) the effect that the RFS has had on greenhouse gas emissions. GAO analyzed RFS data, interviewed experts, and conducted semistructured interviews with 18 experts with expertise on these topics. What GAO Found Evidence from studies, interviews with experts, and GAO's analysis suggest that the Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) was likely associated with modest price increases outside of the Midwest. The experts, stakeholders, and studies identified two main ways in which the RFS may have affected prices. Specifically, the RFS may have (1) increased transportation and storage costs in regions outside the Midwest, and (2) caused an initial increase in refining investment costs that over the long term reduced refining costs for gasoline. The RFS may have also affected retail gasoline prices by increasing transportation costs in certain regions. For example, the Midwest was already producing and blending ethanol, so it had lower transportation costs and had already built necessary storage infrastructure. Other regions began blending ethanol later as rising volumes of ethanol required under the RFS forced more ethanol into the system and as states began blending ethanol. These states incurred new transportation and storage infrastructure costs, which likely resulted in higher gasoline prices compared to those in the Midwest states or states that had not yet begun to blend ethanol. Overall, it is likely that as the expanded blending requirements of the RFS caused non-Midwestern states and localities to begin blending ethanol, these states and localities experienced increased gasoline prices of a few cents per gallon compared to what they otherwise would have been. Most of the experts GAO interviewed generally agreed that to date the RFS has likely had a limited effect, if any, on greenhouse gas emissions. However, the effect has been difficult to assess precisely and GAO found disagreement among some experts about whether the effect has been positive or negative. However, most experts agreed that the effect\u2014whether an increase or decrease\u2014has likely been limited. Regarding meeting RFS greenhouse gas emission reduction",

GSA's smart buildings program includes two key technologies: advanced utility meters and a computer software program known as GSAlink. GAO was asked to review the smart buildings program. This report examines (1) the cost and benefits of the smart buildings program, (2) GSA's efforts to quantify the program's benefits, and (3) challenges GSA faces in implementing smart building technologies and actions GSA is taking to mitigate these challenges. GAO reviewed relevant federal laws and regulations, GSA policies and procedures, and GSA documents and interviewed officials from GSA, the General Services Administration (GSA), and the industry. What GAO Found The General Services Administration (GSA) has taken steps to quantify the benefits of its smart buildings program, but efforts to quantify benefits have been limited. According to GSA officials, the approximate cost of equipping a building with smart building technologies ranged from about $48,000 to $155,000. GSA officials told GAO that the cost of installing GSAlink depends on the condition of the building automation system to which GSAlink is connected as well as the number of individual building components (e.g., chilled water pumps, cooling tower fans, thermostats) to be monitored by GSAlink. GSA officials anticipate that advances in system architecture and reduced software licensing costs will lower the cost of future installations. GSA officials told GAO that the cost of installing GSAlink depends on the condition of the building automation system to which GSAlink is connected as well as the number of individual building components (e.g., chilled water pumps, cooling tower fans, thermostats) to be monitored by GSAlink. GSA officials told GAO that the cost of upgrading building automation systems to operate on GSA's protected information technology network has cost approximately $90,000 per building, on average. However, in some cases these costs can be much higher; integrating older systems in larger buildings has cost up to $3 million, according to GSA officials. GSA officials told GAO that accurately calculating smart building implementation costs can be difficult because GSA typically installs key technologies\u2014such as advanced meters and GSAlink\u2014and makes upgrades necessary to install GSAlink in selected buildings incrementally, sometimes as part of other capital improvement projects.

FERC also issued licenses for the continued operation of existing projects, which FERC relicenses when the licenses expire. GAO was asked to review FERC's oversight of dam safety. This report assesses (1) how FERC collects information from its dam safety inspections and the extent to which FERC analyzes it; (2) how FERC evaluates engineering studies of dam performance to analyze safety; and (3) the extent to which FERC reviews dam safety information during relicensing and the information FERC considers. GAO reviewed FERC's regulations, guidance, and templates and interviewed FERC officials. GAO also reviewed dam safety documentation and interviewed six independent consultants with experience inspecting and analyzing FERC-regulated dams. What GAO Found The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) generally collects information from its dam safety inspections of individual dams, but FERC has not analyzed information collected from its dam safety inspections to evaluate safety risks across its entire portfolio of dams. FERC staff generally followed FERC guidance in conducting these inspections and collecting information from these inspections. For example, staff documented their review of the most recent independent consultant inspection report and potential failure mode analysis for each of the 42 dams GAO reviewed. However, FERC's approach to recording inspection information varies across its regions, thus limiting the usefulness of the information. FERC staff said that use of spreadsheets and other tools to record deficiencies identified during inspections limits their ability to analyze safety information. FERC officials stated that they plan to take steps to improve the consistency of recorded information by replacing the Office of Energy Projects-IT system with a new system, tentatively scheduled for September 2018, that will not replace the functions of the current system. By developing standard language and procedures to standardize the recording of inspection information, FERC officials could help ensure that the information shared across these systems is comparable, steps that would allow FERC to identify the extent of and characteristics associated with common safety deficiencies across its entire portfolio of regulated dams.

What GAO Found The Federal Housing Administration (FHA) made changes to the Distressed Asset Stabilization Program (DASP) in response to concerns about borrower protections and nonprofit participation. FHA changed loan eligibility criteria and bidding processes to increase recoveries to the Mutual Mortgage Insurance Fund. FHA officials said that changes to the program were intended to decrease losses to the MMI Fund and give servicers more time to work with borrowers on loss mitigation. FHA has not provided clear program objectives or key performance measures for DASP. FHA officials told GAO that preserving homeownership and neighborhood stabilization are \"ancillary benefits\" that flow from DASP's objective of maximizing recoveries to the MMI Fund, but not objectives themselves.

Federal law requires the Coast Guard to ensure all eligible servicemembers participate in TAP, but thousands of servicemembers may have transitioned without the support provided by TAP. GAO was asked to review TAP implementation. This report examines (1) what is known about the reliability of TAP data on participation levels and the factors that affect servicemembers' participation, and (2) the extent to which the Coast Guard measures TAP performance and monitors key areas of TAP implementation. GAO surveyed Coast Guard installations with full-time TAP operations; reviewed Coast Guard data on TAP participation for fiscal years 2012 to 2017; visited one Coast Guard installation and interviewed TAP managers from two additional installations selected for diversity in location, among other reasons; and interviewed Coast Guard officials responsible for overseeing TAP implementation for the Coast Guard. What GAO Found The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) does not have complete or reliable data on participation levels in the Transition Assistance Program (TAP), according to agency officials. According to agency officials, a major reason why the data are not reliable is that the Coast Guard lacks an up-to-date Commandant Instruction that specifies when to record TAP participation data. Consequently, the data are updated on an ad-hoc basis, according to agency officials, and may not be timely or complete. For example, one TAP manager said she updates the list of TAP participants for her installation only once every few months because of her other duties. According to federal internal control standards, management should use quality information\u2014including current and timely information\u2014to achieve the entity's objectives and to communicate quality information to external parties.

In December 2016, Congress further amended section 2330a by reducing the scope of the required data collection, specifying the type of contracted services to be included in an inventory summary submitted to Congress, and calling for particular attention to the military departments' review of certain high-risk contracts. In November 2016, GAO reported that DOD's efforts to compile and review its inventory of contracted services had encountered a number of challenges and lacked clearly defined roles and responsibilities for the office. DOD concurred and has since stood up the support office (now called the Total Force Management Support Division) and implemented the Enterprise-wide Contractor Manpower Reporting Application (ECMRA) department-wide. However, DOD has not yet fully identified longer-term relationships. By doing so, DOD would help ensure that efforts to integrate contracted services data into decision-making processes will meet user needs and expectations. The military departments collected data for the fiscal year 2016 inventory using the same data sources\u2014the Federal Procurement Data System-Next Generation (FPDS-NG) and the Enterprise-wide Contractor Manpower Reporting Application (ECMRA)\u2014as they had in prior years, though each department used slightly different processes from one another. OSD's inventory guidance required each military department to submit to the offices of the U.S. Army, Navy, and Air Force a list of all services provided under contract consistent with the guidance and within the scope of section 2330a of title 10, U.S. Code, as amended by section 812 of the fiscal year 2017 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA). The military departments varied somewhat in how they collected and reported their data, which is permitted under OSD's guidance. For example, Army officials stated that they extracted their inventory data for fiscal year 2016 primarily from ECMRA and used FPDS-NG data to fill gaps in data not collected in ECMRA, such as data on aspects of contract competition (e.g., number of offers and small business considerations). Navy officials stated that they captured nearly",

FSA is responsible for ensuring that schools with access to federal student aid are eligible and capable of administering federal student aid. GAO was asked to review FSA's oversight of schools. This report examines (1) how Education evaluates schools' ability to administer federal student aid and (2) the extent to which FSA and the OIG address audit quality. GAO reviewed relevant federal laws, regulations, and guidance; analyzed Education data on schools' certifications and recertification outcomes; and interviewed FSA and OIG officials. What GAO Found The Department of Education's (Education) Federal Student Aid (FSA) evaluates schools' ability to administer federal student aid and approves most schools to receive federal student aid. FSA staff review information collected from schools and third parties, such as annual compliance audits conducted by independent auditors, among other information sources. FSA staff also review information in compliance audits to determine if schools are complying with specific federal student aid requirements. FSA staff from all four of GAO's selected regional offices told GAO they consider results from any recent program review in decisions about recertification and noted that such information, when available, is valuable for assessing schools' administrative capability. From calendar years 2006 through 2017, FSA approved 89 percent of schools new to administering federal student aid for provisional certification and denied 11 percent of schools overall. FSA staff from all four of GAO's selected regional offices told GAO that they typically deny recertification when a school no longer meets eligibility requirements, such as losing accreditation, or when there is significant evidence of serious issues or massive wrongdoing, such as fraud. FSA staff from all four of GAO's selected regional offices told GAO that they provisionally certify schools for a variety of reasons, including when a school submits a late compliance audit or when a recent compliance audit indicates that a school could potentially have significant problems. FSA and the Office of Inspector General (OIG) have taken steps to address audit quality and the information available to FSA staff when making certification decisions. For example, FSA and OIG recently have taken steps to address audit quality and the information available to FSA staff when making certification decisions. For example, FSA and OIG recently have taken steps to",
    "gao_GAO-18-248": "Why GAO Did This Study In recent decades, economic and demographic factors have contributed to an increase in the number of SSDI beneficiaries and increased program costs, which has reduced the size of the Disability Insurance Trust Fund reserves from a peak of $215.8 billion in 2008 to $46.3 billion in 2016. In 2016, about 8.8 million workers with disabilities and 1.8 million dependents received SSDI payments, totaling $142.7 billion, of which $133.6 billion was paid to the workers and $9.1 billion to their dependents. GAO was asked to review the potential impacts of proposals to expand private disability insurance (PDI) on SSDI. This report examines (1) the extent to which SSDI and PDI are covered by SSDI, (2) the implications of the proposals for SSDI, and (3) the potential impacts on employers and employees. GAO analyzed SSA and DOL data on SSDI and PDI coverage, reviewed relevant literature, and interviewed SSA and DOL officials and representatives from employee advocacy groups, insurance companies, and insurance associations. What GAO Found Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI) and long-term employer-sponsored private disability insurance (PDI) are both potentially covered by SSDI, but SSDI coverage is much more prevalent at higher wage levels and in certain occupations and industries than others. SSDI coverage is higher across all industries and income levels, while PDI coverage is much more prevalent at higher wage levels and in certain occupations and industries than others. In contrast, PDI coverage is generally not portable if the individual leaves the employer offering PDI. PDI benefits are generally lower than SSDI, but are designed to provide more income replacement for low-income workers than higher-income workers. GAO's literature review identified three distinct proposals to expand PDI\u2014through some type of federal action\u2014as a way to provide savings for SSDI; however, GAO was unable to assess the implications of these proposals on SSDI. The three proposals assume that PDI coverage would provide vocational assistance, workplace accommodations, and partial income replacement to employees with work-limiting disabilities. Each proposal assumes that PDI expansion would result in the provision of effective return-to-work assistance earlier than would occur under SSDI. According to the authors of the three proposals, their proposals would slow the growth of the SSDI program by increasing work attachment of potential applicants or beneficiaries of SSDI and revers",

However, many individuals do not have advance directives, which are written instructions recognized under state law and relating to the provision of health care when an individual is incapacitated. GAO was asked to review the extent to which individuals have advance directives and POLST forms. This report examines (1) the extent to which individuals have advance directives and POLST forms, and (2) strategies selected states have taken to improve individuals' and providers' understanding of and access to these documents. GAO reviewed relevant laws, regulations, and reports; analyzed information from websites related to advance care planning for all states; and interviewed officials from national stakeholder organizations, state agencies, and health care providers in four selected states\u2014California, Idaho, Oregon, and West Virginia\u2014and selected articles on advance care planning. GAO also interviewed officials from state agencies and stakeholder organizations in each of the four selected states. What GAO Found GAO found websites related to advance care planning for every state; however, the amount of information on these websites varied by state. In addition, about a quarter of states had registries to provide access to completed advance directives, POLST forms, or both. For all states, either government or non-government websites provided information, which could include blank documents, on advance care planning for individuals and providers within the state. However, the amount of available information about advance care planning varied by state. The information available online varied from having an advance care planning document available to download, to extensive information on advance care planning. For example, in Mississippi, the State Board of Medical Licensure provided a POLST document that could be downloaded from its webpage with no additional information. In contrast, California\u2014through its state attorney general's website\u2014offered a blank advance directive document that could be downloaded, as well as additional information on advance directives, including who should fill out particular types of advance care planning documents, and the importance of filling out these documents. To give providers, individuals, or both access to completed advance care planning documents, about one-quarter of states (14) had active registries (either electronic or paper-based) of completed advance directives, POLST forms, or both, as of November 2018.

    "gao_GAO-19-160": "Why GAO Did This Study The Air Force has experienced a reduction in its end strength since fiscal year 2014, which reduced its authorized positions by about 4,000 maintainers. The Air Force has also experienced staffing gaps of experienced maintainers\u2014those at the 5- and 7-levels who are most qualified to meet mission needs. GAO was asked to review the Air Force's aircraft maintainer workforce. This report examines the extent to which the Air Force has (1) experienced aircraft maintainer staffing gaps, (2) experienced maintainers, and (3) taken steps to help retain maintainers. GAO analyzed Air Force data on aircraft maintainer loss and reenlistment rates, and interviewed officials. GAO also conducted five discussion groups with aircraft maintainers to obtain their views on factors affecting maintainer retention, on-the-job training capacity, and commercial aviation industry opportunities. What GAO Found The Air Force has significantly reduced overall aircraft maintainer staffing gaps since fiscal year 2016, in part by increasing accessions. While the Air Force has consistently met its technical school completion rate goals for newly accessed aircraft maintainers, it continues to have staffing gaps of experienced maintainers\u2014those at the 5- and 7-levels who are most qualified to meet mission needs. Air Force officials attributed these staffing gaps to an increase in authorized positions\u2014due in part to the acquisition of the F-35 and increased maintenance needs for legacy aircraft, such as the F-15, F-16, and B-52\u2014and a decrease in actual staffing levels, due in part to a reduction in end strength from fiscal years 2014 through 2015. These officials stated that the Air Force reduced its actual maintainer staffing levels through involuntary separations and reduced accessions due, in part, to the planned divestiture of the A-10 and other aircraft types. However, these officials stated that the divestiture did not occur, which contributed to further staffing gaps. The Air Force has also experienced staffing gaps of experienced aircraft maintainers\u2014those at the 5- and 7-levels\u2014in 7 of the past 8 fiscal years. While the Air Force's actual maintainer staffing levels were 99 percent of authorized levels in fiscal year 2017, 3-level maintainers were the only skill level without a staffing gap. Specifically, in fiscal year 2017, the Air Force had a gap of 2,044 5-level maintainers (94 percent of authorized levels filled) and a",

GAO was asked to review federal agencies' management of personal property. This report examines (1) how selected federal agencies assess whether personal property is needed and (2) how selected federal agencies dispose of unneeded personal property, and how, if at all, space reduction efforts have affected disposals. GAO reviewed relevant federal statutes and regulations, and interviewed officials from five selected federal agencies\u2014the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the General Services Administration (GSA), the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), and the Internal Revenue Service (IRS)\u2014and five selected nonfederal entities. GAO also reviewed relevant federal regulations and policies and interviewed officials from the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), the General Services Administration (GSA), and the Department of Agriculture (USDA). What GAO Found The five selected federal agencies GAO reviewed had policies and processes for carrying out their responsibilities to maintain adequate accountability systems and inventory controls for property under their control. All five agencies have policies for regularly inventorying their personal property to physically locate and verify property tracked in their asset management systems. However, the five agencies did not have a systematic process for assessing the continued need for personal property. For example, four of the five agencies did not require property custodians or other property users to assess property for continued need. Furthermore, these four agencies' policies did not have specific criteria for the property custodian or user to assess property for continued need. OMB staff and GSA officials agreed that assessing all types of property\u2014accountable and non-accountable\u2014for continued need is important and called-for by internal control standards. Selected agencies used GSA's automated process to dispose of property once they had made the determination it was no longer needed to support their agency's mission. GSA has also issued guidance to help agencies dispose of property under this process. Selected agencies reported little difficulty disposing of property from space reduction efforts, such as Freeze the Footprint and Reduce the Footprint, the same way as other personal property\u2014using GSA's disposal process. For property that was declared excess following a space reduction project, agencies reported transferring, donating, selling, or abandoning or destroying it. For property that was",
    "gao_GAO-18-500": "Why GAO Did This Study Many consumer products are differentiated to appeal specifically to men or women through differences in packaging, scent, or other product characteristics. These differences related to gender can affect manufacturing and marketing costs that may contribute to price differences in products targeted to different genders. GAO was asked to review issues related to gender-related price differences. This report examines (1) how prices compared for selected categories of consumer goods that are differentiated for men and women, and potential reasons for any significant price differences; (2) what is known about the extent to which men and women may pay different prices in, or experience different levels of access to, markets for credit and goods and services that are not differentiated based on gender; (3) the extent to which federal agencies have identified and taken steps to address any concerns about gender-related price differences; and (4) state and local government efforts to address concerns about gender-related price differences. GAO analyzed retail price data from Nielsen Company (Nielsen) for calendar year 2016 and reviewed academic literature on price differences. GAO also interviewed officials from the Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection (BCFP), Federal Trade Commission (FTC), and Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD). GAO also reviewed a sample of consumer complaints from databases managed by BCFP, FTC, and HUD. What GAO Found In 5 out of 10 product categories GAO analyzed, personal care products targeted to women sold at higher average prices than those targeted to men after controlling for certain observable factors. For 2 of the 10 product categories, men's versions sold at higher average prices. While the factors GAO controlled for likely proxy for various costs and consumer preferences, GAO could not fully observe all underlying differences in costs and demand for products targeted to different genders. As a result, GAO could not determine the extent to which the gender-based price differences GAO observed may be attributed to gender bias as opposed to other factors. GAO reviewed studies that compared prices for men and women in four markets where the product or service is not differentiated by gender: mortgages, small business credit, auto purchases, and auto repairs. These studies found mixed evidence of differences in interest rates and access to credit. For example, one study found that women paid higher interest rates for certain subprime loans. However, the authors did not control for other factors that could affect borrowing costs, such as differences in education, shopping behaviors, and geographic location.",
    "gao_GAO-18-613T": "Why GAO Did This Study The CFATS Act of 2014 required DHS to implement a program to help facilities develop and submit security plans to DHS. The act also required DHS to implement an expedited approval program, which allows facilities to develop and submit security plans based on specific standards published by DHS. This testimony is based on GAO's ongoing work on the CFATS program. This statement is based on GAO's ongoing work on the program and updates information from DHS on actions it has taken to address prior GAO recommendations. GAO reviewed DHS documents and interviewed DHS officials. What GAO Found GAO's past work has identified progress and challenges in a number of areas related to the Department of Homeland Security's (DHS) management of the Chemical Facility Anti-Terrorism Standards (CFATS) program. In May 2014, GAO found that more than 1,300 facilities had reported having ammonium nitrate holdings to DHS. However, based on GAO's review of state data and records, there were more facilities with ammonium nitrate holdings than those that had reported to DHS under the CFATS program. In July 2015, GAO reported that DHS had identified about 1,000 additional facilities that should have reported information to comply with CFATS and subsequently contacted these facilities to ensure compliance. DHS has fully addressed both of these recommendations. Specifically, DHS implemented an updated Top-Screen in October 2016 and now collects data from facilities and calculates the Distance of Concern itself, rather than relying on the facilities' calculation. DHS also took actions to better assess regulated facilities' risks in order to place the facilities into the appropriate risk tier. In April 2013, GAO reported that DHS's risk assessment approach did not consider all of the elements of threat, vulnerability, and consequence associated with a terrorist attack involving certain chemicals. GAO recommended that DHS enhance its risk assessment approach to incorporate all elements of risk and conduct a peer review after doing so. DHS agreed with GAO's recommendations and has made progress towards addressing them. Specifically, DHS revised its Chemical Security Assessment Tool (CSAT) to make it easier to understand and less burdensome. DHS also revised its procedures for reviewing facilities' security plans to address DHS managers' concerns that the original process was slow, overly",
    "gao_GAO-18-8": "Why GAO Did This Study USMS is responsible for ensuring that federal employees are selected based on merit. GAO was asked to review USMS's merit promotion process. This report examines (1) the extent to which USMS has aligned its merit promotion policy with federal guidelines and developed a consistent process, and (2) the extent to which USMS has taken steps to understand and address employee concerns about the merit promotion process. GAO reviewed relevant federal laws, regulations, and guidance; analyzed USMS data on employee views on the merit promotion process; and interviewed USMS officials. What GAO Found The U.S. Marshal Service (USMS) has aligned its merit promotion policy with federal guidelines and developed a consistent process. GAO determined that the USMS merit promotion policy aligns with relevant provisions of title 5 of the United States Code, and title 5 of the Code of Federal Regulations. Specifically, the most recent version of the USMS Merit Promotion Plan, which was revised in November 2016, outlines the mechanisms for affording merit staffing and promotional opportunities to competitive status candidates for GS-13, GS-14, and GS-15 1811 operational law enforcement positions. The plan states that it is the policy of the USMS to maintain a sound staffing program that will ensure that USMS fills positions from among the best qualified candidates and that the selection, assignment, and promotion of employees are on the basis of job-related criteria. USMS has developed a multi-step process based on its merit promotion plan to assess and select eligible candidates for promotion. USMS does not monitor key aspects of its merit promotion process, such as the implementation of the scoring component of its rating process or compliance with its temporary promotion policy, but is taking steps to improve these aspects. For example, USMS has begun to implement changes that could address these deficiencies. For example, USMS announced a planned change to its rating process in February 2017, which entails having a third-party contractor, rather than USMS employees, determine candidates' competency scores using a scenario-based competency assessment. However, USMS has not documented guidance for raters to ensure consistent application of the guidance. Specifically, USMS lacks documented guidance for raters. Specifically, USMS provides raters with benchmarks and verbal guidance on how to apply the benchmarks, but USMS has not documented guidance for raters. Six employees",

In July 2017, GAO reported that the United States had suspended the refugee application process because of fraud. This testimony discusses (1) State's and UNHCR's efforts to ensure the integrity of the refugee referral process and (2) the extent to which State, USCIS, and their partners have implemented antifraud measures to address fraud risks. This statement is based on GAO's July 2017 report, Refugee Application Processing: State, USCIS, and Partners Have Implemented Antifraud Measures, but Could Further Assess Staff and Applicant Fraud Risks (GAO-17-706). GAO reviewed relevant documents and interviewed officials from State, USCIS, and their partners. GAO also visited four refugee processing centers (RSC) selected based on the number of refugees accepted and the number of refugees who were interviewed. What GAO Found In July 2017, GAO found that the Department of State (State) and the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) have worked together on several measures designed to ensure the integrity of the refugee referral process. State and UNHCR have developed standard operating procedures (SOPs) and identity management systems to combat the risk of fraud and worked with State to implement these activities in the resettlement process. State has control activities in place to monitor how RSCs implement policies and procedures for the U.S. Refugee Application Processing (USRAP) program, but it does not have outcome-based performance indicators to assess whether RSCs are meeting their objectives under USRAP. State has established objectives and monitors several quantitative goals for RSCs, but it has not established outcome-based performance indicators for key RSC activities such as prescreening applicants or accurate case file preparation, or monitored RSC performance consistently across such indicators. Developing outcome-based performance indicators, as required by State policy and performance management guidance, and monitoring RSC performance against such indicators on a regular basis would better position State to determine whether all RSCs are processing refugee applications in accordance with their responsibilities under USRAP.

The act also requires OMB and Treasury to ensure that the standards are applied to the data made available on USAspending.gov. The act also requires OMB and Treasury to report on agencies' implementation of the act. GAO was asked to review OIG reports on agencies' implementation of the act. This report describes (1) the reported scope of work covered and type of audit standards OIGs used in their reviews of agencies' DATA Act spending data; (2) any variations in the reported implementation and use of data standards and quality of agencies' data, and any common issues and recommendations reported by the OIGs; and (3) actions, if any, that OMB and Treasury have reported taking or planning to take to use the results of OIG reviews to help monitor agencies' implementation of the act. GAO obtained and reviewed 53 OIG reports issued on or before January 31, 2018, including reports related to 24 Chief Financial Officers Act of 1990 (CFO Act) agencies and 29 non-CFO Act agency OIGs. GAO also surveyed OIGs to obtain further details on the design and results of their efforts to conduct statistical samples to select and test agencies' data submissions and reviews of internal controls. GAO also interviewed OMB and Treasury officials about how they used or planned to use the results of the OIG DATA Act reviews to assist them in their monitoring of agencies' implementation of the act.

    "gao_GAO-17-775": "Why GAO Did This Study GPRAMA is intended to address a number of persistent federal performance challenges, including focusing attention on crosscutting issues and enhancing the use and usefulness of performance information. GAO has issued a number of reports on GPRAMA implementation. This report examines (1) the extent to which the executive branch has made progress in addressing crosscutting issues and (2) the extent to which federal managers have reported improvements in their use of performance information in decision making. GAO analyzed GPRAMA and OMB guidance, surveyed federal managers, and interviewed OMB and agency officials. What GAO Found The executive branch has made progress in addressing crosscutting issues, but continued attention is needed to better manage them. GAO's past work has shown that agencies continue to face difficulties when working together on crosscutting issues, but also that implementing certain GPRAMA requirements can have a positive effect on collaboration. For example, GAO's 2017 survey of federal managers shows that they use information obtained from performance measurement to a great or very great extent when coordinating program efforts with internal or external organizations. GAO also found that agencies face a variety of challenges when working across organizational boundaries to deliver programs and improve performance. For example, interagency groups have, at times, encountered difficulty clarifying roles and responsibilities or developing shared outcomes and performance measures. In contrast, GAO's past work demonstrates that implementing certain GPRAMA requirements can have a positive effect on collaboration. For example, in May 2016, GAO found that OMB and the Performance Improvement Council (PIC) updated the governance structure for CAP goals to include both agency-level and Executive Office of the President goal leaders and held regular, senior-level reviews on CAP goal progress. Moreover, GAO's 2017 survey of federal managers shows that CAP goals, agency priority goals (APG), and related data-driven reviews\u2014also called quarterly performance reviews (QPR)\u2014are associated with reported higher levels of collaboration with internal and external stakeholders. OMB staff told GAO that they believed they were working in line with the intentions of GPRAMA, which realigned the timing of goal setting with presidential terms, to better take into account changes in priorities. OMB staff also stated that they expect most of the work to continue towards a new and refocused CAP goal on infrastructure permitting modernization. Effectively implementing various GPR",

Effective management of IT is critical for agencies to achieve successful outcomes. This is particularly true for IRS, given the role of IT in enabling the agency to carry out its mission and responsibilities. For fiscal year 2016, IRS was pursuing 23 major and 114 non-major IT investments to carry out its mission. According to the agency, it expended approximately $2.7 billion on these investments during fiscal year 2016, including $1.9 billion, or 70 percent, for operations and maintenance activities, and approximately $800 million, or 30 percent, for development, modernization, and enhancement. GAO has previously reported on a number of the agency's major investments, to include the following investments in development, modernization, and enhancement: The Affordable Care Act investment encompasses the planning, development, and implementation of IT systems needed to support tax administration responsibilities associated with key provisions of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act. Customer Account Data Engine 2 is being developed to replace the Individual Master File investment, IRS's authoritative data source for individual tax account data. The Return Review Program is IRS's system of record for fraud detection. As such, it is intended to enhance the agency's capabilities to detect, resolve, and prevent criminal and civil tax noncompliance. In light of these ongoing challenges, in February 2015, GAO added improving the management of IT acquisitions and operations to its list of high-risk areas for the federal government. This area highlights several critical IT initiatives in need of additional congressional oversight, including (1) reviews of troubled projects; (2) efforts to increase the use of incremental development; (3) efforts to provide transparency relative to the cost, schedule, and risk levels for major IT investments; (4) reviews of agencies' operational investments; (5) data center consolidation; and (6) efforts to streamline agencies' portfolios of IT investments.

FRA is the primary federal agency responsible for safety at grade crossings. FRA provides safety grants to states to improve safety at public grade crossings. FRA also oversees FRA's rail-safety oversight activities. GAO was asked to review FRA's safety oversight. This report examines (1) what has been the focus of FRA's grade-crossing-safety research, (2) how states select and implement grade-crossing projects and what railroad- and state-reported data are available from FRA to inform states' decisions, and (3) the challenges states reported in implementing and assessing projects and the extent to which FHWA assesses the program's effectiveness. GAO reviewed relevant statutes, FRA regulations, and FRA reports and interviewed FRA and FHWA officials and eight selected states, selected based on a variety of factors, including the number of grade crossings and the amount of Section 130 Program funding they received. GAO also reviewed FRA and FHWA documents and interviewed FRA and FHWA officials. What GAO Found The Federal Railroad Administration (FRA) has focused research on understanding and addressing risky behavior by drivers at grade crossings. FRA has sponsored a number of research efforts to better understand the causes of grade-crossing crashes and identify potential ways to improve engineering, education, and enforcement efforts. For example, FRA sponsored an in-depth data analysis of grade-crossing crashes to better identify which crossing characteristics increase the risk of an accident. FRA also works with states and localities to research and develop new protective devices and other safety measures targeted at improving driver behavior at grade crossings. FRA also shares information on its research in various ways with state departments of transportation (DOT), because states are responsible for deciding which safety measures to install at grade crossings. FRA also shares information on its research in various ways with state DOTs, because states are responsible for deciding which safety measures to install at grade crossings.

Congress has provided the CMO with statutory authorities and responsibilities to help the department implement its business reform efforts. The NDAA for Fiscal Year 2018 included a provision for GAO to review DOD's implementation of the CMO position. This report examines the extent to which DOD has implemented the authorities and responsibilities of its CMO position and issued guidance communicating within the department the authorities and responsibilities of the position. GAO reviewed relevant laws and key documents, and interviewed DOD officials. What GAO Found The Department of Defense (DOD) has taken some steps to implement its Chief Management Officer (CMO) position, but key issues related to authorities and responsibilities remain unresolved. In February 2018, DOD formally established the position of the CMO and an office in support of the CMO (OCMO). In establishing the office, the Secretary of Defense stated that all resources and personnel (military, civilian, and contractor) assigned within the existing DCMO office were to transfer to the OCMO. Generally, the department has been focused on updating organizational structures and strengthening the OCMO's data capabilities. However, DOD leadership has not resolved three key issues related to the CMO's statutory authorities and responsibilities, including: (1) how the CMO will exercise the authority to direct the military departments; (2) how the CMO will exercise oversight of the Defense Agency and DOD Field Activities (DAFA); and (3) which responsibilities, if any, will transfer from the Chief Information Officer (CIO) to the CMO.

GAO was asked to review CDC's information security program. This report assesses the extent to which CDC has effectively implemented an information security program and controls to protect the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of its information on selected information systems. GAO reviewed a non-generalizable sample of CDC's information systems, and interviewed agency officials. What GAO Found The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) had implemented numerous controls over the 24 systems GAO reviewed, but had not always effectively implemented controls to protect the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of these systems and the information maintained on them. Deficiencies existed in the technical controls and agency-wide information security program that were intended to (1) identify risk, (2) protect systems from threats and vulnerabilities, (3) detect cybersecurity events, (4) respond to these events, and (5) recover system operations. These deficiencies increased the risk that sensitive personally identifiable and health-related information, including information regarding the transfer of biological agents and toxins dangerous to public health, could be disclosed or modified without authorization. CDC had implemented numerous controls over the 24 systems GAO reviewed, but had not always effectively implemented controls to protect the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of these systems and the information maintained on them. Specifically, CDC had categorized the 24 systems GAO reviewed, but the assigned impact level was not always appropriate. In this regard, the agency did not ensure that high-impact systems were logically secured from a lower-risk system. CDC had developed system-level risk assessments for the 8 selected mission-essential systems, but had not assessed threats, documented risks associated with less secure configuration settings, or monitored its assessments to address changes to the operating environment. CDC had also documented numerous policies, procedures, and standards that addressed each of the 18 control families identified in the National Institute of Standards and Technology's cybersecurity framework. However, the agency had not (1) categorized the risk-related impact of a key system, identified threats, or reassessed risk for systems or facilities when needed; (2) sufficiently documented technical requirements in policies, procedures, and standards;",

In 2015, OMB issued guidance that required agencies to report on the status of their major IT investments. GAO was asked to review the implementation of FITARA. This report examines (1) the extent to which agencies have reported that their major IT investments are adequately implementing incremental development and (2) the extent to which OMB has provided agencies with the guidance needed to ensure that agencies certify that their major IT investments are adequately implementing incremental development. GAO reviewed OMB guidance and OMB guidance, and interviewed officials from 24 agencies selected based on their IT investments and OMB's guidance. What GAO Found As of August 2016, 21 of the 24 agencies in GAO's review had reported that more than half of their major software development investments were certified by the Chief Information Officer (CIO) as implementing adequate incremental development. However, the remaining 63 investments offered various interpretations regarding what investments needed to be certified. For example, officials of several agencies reported that they were not utilizing incremental development for certain investments. In other instances, agencies did not provide a response to OMB regarding the question in the major IT business case about certification, or responded that they did not consider certification to be applicable for their investments. However, based on OMB's guidance, a number of these \"not applicable\" responses were incorrectly reported, as these agencies had investments that included software development and were, therefore, required to report on the certification of adequate incremental development. In addition, officials from 21 agencies reported that the certification process was beneficial because they used the information obtained during the process to assist with management oversight of major IT investments, including identifying investments that could be using a more effective incremental approach and using lessons learned to improve the agency's incremental processes. Nevertheless, officials from 21 agencies reported that the certification process was beneficial because they used the information obtained during the process to assist with management oversight of major IT investments, including identifying investments that could be using a more effective incremental approach and using lessons learned to improve the agency's incremental processes. OMB's guidance allows agencies the flexibility to define the processes that CIOs use for ensuring the certification of adequate incremental development. However, only 4 of the 24 agencies GAO reviewed (Commerce, DHS, Energy, and Transportation) had clearly defined processes and policies to ensure that the CIO will certify that major",

This testimony is based on GAO's September 2018 report, American Indian and Alaska Native Youth: Involvement in Federal, State, and Local Justice Systems (GAO-2018-09-322). It examines (1) available data on the involvement of Native American youth in federal, state, and local justice systems and (2) the extent to which DOJ and HHS have provided grants and cooperative agreements to tribal governments and Native American organizations to help prevent or address delinquency among Native American youth. GAO analyzed available data from federal, state, and local justice systems from 2010 through 2016, and reviewed a non-generalizable sample of applications for 122 DOJ and HHS grant programs. GAO also interviewed officials from DOJ's Office of Justice Programs and seven HHS operating divisions to obtain their perspectives on why tribal governments and Native American organizations might not apply for grant programs that do not specify them as a primary beneficiary. What GAO Found In its September 2018 report, GAO found that from 2010 through 2016, the number of Native American youth in federal and state and local justice systems declined across all phases of the justice process\u2014arrest, adjudication, and confinement\u2014according to GAO's analysis of available data. At the federal level, arrests by federal agencies dropped from 60 Native American youth in 2010 to 20 in 2016, and at the state and local level, arrests of Native American youth declined by almost 40 percent from 18,295 arrested in 2010 to 11,002 in 2016. GAO also found a number of similarities between Native American and non-Native American youth in state and local justice systems. For example, the offenses that Native American youth and non-Native American youth were arrested, adjudicated, and confined for were generally similar. In contrast, GAO's analysis also showed a number of differences between Native American and non-Native American youth in the federal justice system. For example, the majority of Native American youth involved in most state and local systems was generally similar to their representation in the youth populations in those states. For these reasons, the percentage of Native American youth involved in the federal justice system is",

DOT and DOL are responsible for regulating commercial trucks, including long-haul and local-haul, which are the most common types of trucks. DOT and DOL have taken steps to prepare for the potential workforce effects of automated trucking, including holding public listening sessions and coordinating with DOL to gather information on the potential workforce effects of automated trucking. GAO was asked to review the potential workforce effects of automated trucking. This report examines (1) what is known about how and when automated vehicle technologies could affect commercial trucks; (2) what is known about how the adoption of automated trucks could affect the commercial trucking workforce; and (3) the extent to which DOT and DOL are preparing to assist drivers whose jobs may be affected by automated trucking. GAO reviewed relevant federal laws and regulations, and literature; interviewed stakeholders, including technology developers, industry associations, and workforce development boards; and analyzed federal data on the current and future trucking workforce. What GAO Found According to stakeholders GAO spoke with and literature GAO reviewed, automated trucks, including self-driving trucks, are being developed, generally for long-haul trucking. Specifically, technology developers and researchers told GAO there is ongoing development and testing of truck platoons, which involve one or more trucks following closely behind a lead truck, linked by wireless\u2014or vehicle-to-vehicle\u2014communication. Several stakeholders GAO spoke with and literature GAO reviewed identified several technology-related limitations that may affect automated truck development and deployment. For example, several stakeholders said automated trucks may require simpler operating environments, such as highways, in the near term because they are less complex for the technology to navigate than roads in an urban setting, for example. In addition, several stakeholders said there may be challenges with self-driving trucks with no person inside when responding to a tire blowout or other mechanical problems. Several stakeholders also noted that public acceptance concerning the safety of platooning and self-driving trucks may pose a challenge to the deployment of these trucks. Several stakeholders and literature identified several other factors, such as public perception and cybersecurity, that could affect timing for the development and deployment of automated trucks.

The federal government has jurisdiction over crimes in Indian country, but the federal government does not have jurisdiction over non-Native American youth. GAO was asked to review the federal justice system for youth. This report examines (1) trends in the number of Native American youth involved in the justice systems and (2) the extent to which DOJ and HHS have provided funding to help prevent or address delinquency among Native American youth. GAO analyzed available data on youth involved in the justice systems from 2010 through 2016 and interviewed DOJ, HHS, and five Native American organizations that provide assistance in national policy areas. GAO also reviewed relevant federal laws and regulations and interviewed officials from DOJ, HHS, and the U.S. Sentencing Commission. What GAO Found From 2010 through 2016, the number of Native American youth involved with state and local and federal justice systems declined, according to GAO's analysis of available data. This decline occurred across all phases of the justice process\u2014arrest, adjudication, and confinement in facilities. The involvement of these Native American youth in the state and local and federal justice systems was also concentrated in certain geographic areas. Further, the vast majority of these Native American youth came into contact with state and local justice systems, not the federal system. Analysis of available data also indicates that the percent of Native American youth involved in the federal justice system during the period reviewed was greater than their representation in the nationwide youth population. In contrast, the percent of Native American youth involved in most state and local justice systems was similar to their representation in youth populations in those states. DOJ officials and representatives of Native American organizations GAO interviewed attributed the greater percent of Native American youth involved in the federal justice system and the differences shown by GAO's analysis to federal government jurisdiction over crimes in Indian country, as well as the absence of general federal government jurisdiction over non-Native American youth. DOJ and HHS offered at least 122 discretionary grant programs that grantees could use to help prevent or address delinquency among Native American youth. DOJ and HHS awarded approximately $1.2 billion in first-year awards during this period, about $207.7 million of which they collectively awarded to tribal governments and Native American organizations.

RRP is IRS's primary system for detecting identity theft refund fraud and other refund fraud. GAO was asked to review RRP. This report examines (1) RRP's capabilities to detect and prevent refund fraud and (2) opportunities to improve RRP's detection and selection of fraudulent returns. GAO reviewed IRS documents and interviewed IRS officials. GAO also reviewed RRP's data and information available to RRP. What GAO Found The Internal Revenue Service's (IRS) Return Review Program (RRP) is one of IRS's primary systems for detecting identity theft refund fraud and preventing IRS from paying invalid refunds. RRP uses advanced analytic techniques and evaluates data from numerous IRS systems and external entities to assign multiple scores to individual returns claiming refunds. RRP also uses analytic techniques to identify patterns predictive of identity theft and other refund fraud. RRP also uses information from its research efforts and external entities to improve RRP's detection and enforcement efforts. IRS officials told GAO they use information from these efforts to update RRP's detection tools for the upcoming filing season. IRS plans to continue developing RRP to expand its capabilities to detect refund fraud on business and partnership returns, as well as on individual returns that improperly claim nonrefundable tax credits. IRS officials told GAO they are working to develop rules, models, and filters in RRP to detect refund fraud on business and partnership returns. IRS has not fully evaluated opportunities to improve data available to RRP to enhance RRP's detection and selection of fraudulent returns. For example, IRS has not yet evaluated the costs and benefits of making more information from paper returns available electronically. IRS has not fully evaluated the costs and benefits of expanding RRP to analyze returns not claiming refunds, in addition to returns with refunds.

GAO has issued a number of reports and testimonies addressing EPA's management and operations, water issues, and public health and environmental justice. This statement discusses (1) the status of EPA's implementation of GAO recommendations and (2) the benefits resulting from EPA's implementation of GAO recommendations and related work. This statement is based on prior GAO reports issued from 2007 through 2016 and selected updates conducted in August 2017. What GAO Found As of August 23, 2017, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) had implemented 191 of the 318 GAO recommendations made to EPA since fiscal year 2007, and the recommendations fall into six broad categories that relate to EPA operations and programs. EPA had not yet fully implemented the remaining 127 recommendations. For recommendations that GAO made over 4 years ago (i.e., fiscal years 2007 to 2012), EPA had implemented 77 percent. For recommendations made since fiscal year 2013, EPA had implemented 34 percent. The 318 recommendations GAO made to EPA since fiscal year 2007 fall into six broad categories that relate to EPA operations and programs and generally align with many of the goals and strategies identified in EPA's Fiscal Year 2014-2018 Strategic Plan. These six broad categories are: (1) management and operations; (2) water issues, which includes water infrastructure, drinking water, water quality, and ecosystem restoration; (3) environmental contamination and cleanup, which includes environmental cleanup, pollution prevention, hazardous and other waste programs, and emergency management; (4) toxics, chemical safety, and pesticides; (5) public health and environmental justice; and (6) air quality, climate change, and energy efficiency. The percentage of recommendations implemented within each category ranged from 80 percent for the environmental contamination and cleanup category to 48 percent in the management and operations category. Most of the recommendations that EPA has not implemented fall into three categories: management and operations, water issues, and environmental contamination and cleanup. The remaining quarter of the recommendations fell into the other three categories of toxics, chemical safety, and pesticides; air quality, climate change, and energy efficiency; and public health and environmental justice. EPA's implementation of GAO recommendations and related work has resulted in process and programmatic improvements and financial benefits. Since fiscal year 2007, GAO has identified improvements",

In the fall of 2017, the Army began a new modernization effort to rapidly develop and field new capabilities. Section 1061 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2018 included a provision for GAO to report on the Army's modernization strategy. This report assesses (1) the status of the Army's efforts to establish new acquisition organizations while balancing near- and long-term modernization; and (2) the extent to which the Army has applied leading practices to do so. GAO reviewed Army documents and interviewed Army officials and cross-functional team pilots. GAO also reviewed Army directives and Army guidance and interviewed Army officials. What GAO Found The Army has established eight cross-functional team pilots to pilot its modernization efforts and has begun planning the transition to long-term capabilities. The cross-functional team pilots were pilot programs to improve the quality and timeliness of requirements and technology development. The Army Futures Command is in the process of establishing its policies, processes, and functions as well as its relationships with other Army organizations. It plans to reach full capability by July 2019. The Army has already identified near-term priorities and realigned over $1 billion in science and technology funding for long-term modernization. The Army has generally applied leading practices for technology development and establishing effective cross-functional teams, and has begun to apply leading practices for mergers and organizational transformations for the Army Futures Command. During the Army's pilot phase for its eight cross-functional team pilots, the teams took actions consistent with leading practices for technology development, such as bringing together requirements developers and warfighters, planning prototype demonstrations, and maturing technology prior to beginning system development. The Army's pilot teams also applied eight leading practices GAO has identified for establishing effective cross-functional teams to varying degrees. In addition, senior Army leadership has been clear in its support for the new command and has clearly outlined a timeframe for its establishment, actions that are in line with the leading practices for mergers and organizational transformations GAO has identified in prior work. Whether further application of these leading practices will continue under the new command is unclear as the role of the cross-functional teams has not yet been formalized and Army Futures Command has not yet taken all the steps needed to reach full operational capability.",

GAO was asked to review federal law enforcement responses to incidents involving individuals with mental illness. This report addresses the following key questions: (1) What challenges, if any, do federal law enforcement officers at selected Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and Department of Justice (DOJ) components face when responding to incidents involving individuals with mental illness? (2) What type of training, policies, and guidance, if any, are in place at selected DHS and DOJ components to prepare federal law enforcement officers for responding to incidents involving individuals with mental illness? (3) What leading practices or tools have relevant stakeholders cited for effective responses to incidents involving individuals with mental illness, and how have DHS and DOJ components leveraged information from other knowledgeable parties? GAO reviewed relevant laws, guidance, and documents and interviewed officials from DHS and DOJ. GAO also held discussion groups of six to eleven federal law enforcement officers and agents within each of the five components in its scope. GAO also interviewed officials from the components and other knowledgeable parties. What GAO Found According to the DHS and DOJ law enforcement officers and agents GAO interviewed, they are not positioned to diagnose any specific mental health condition that an individual might have, as they are not trained mental health professionals. However, responding to incidents involving individuals with mental illness can be challenging for multiple reasons, including determining whether the person is suffering from a mental illness or from another issue, such as drug addiction, and communicating with the person, for example, when a person may be suffering from delusions. These officers and agents face these challenges while also being responsible for ensuring their own safety and that of others in the area. Some of the common challenges officers and agents identified during GAO's discussion groups follow. For example, determining whether an individual has a mental illness or is experiencing other issues is challenging and may be complicated by language barriers. In addition, officers and agents said they must rely on state and local entities in the area (e.g., law enforcement, hospitals) to provide assistance for individuals. The law enforcement components within GAO's scope at DHS and DOJ have policies or guidance in place that addresses responding to incidents involving individuals with mental illness.

The Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) is the federal agency with primary responsibility for coordinating disaster response. GAO was asked to review the 2017 CDBG-DR grants. This report examines (1) the extent to which HUD has allocated CDBG-DR funds to the 2017 grantees and (2) the extent to which HUD has reviewed the grantees' initial steps and plans for monitoring the funds. GAO reviewed HUD documents and interviewed HUD officials and grantees in four states selected based on their CDBG-DR funding and other factors. What GAO Found As of January 2019, all four of the 2017 CDBG-DR grantees had entered into grant agreements with HUD for their initial 2017 CDBG-DR funds, but they needed to take additional steps before disbursing funds to individuals affected by the 2017 hurricanes. The grant agreements required grantees to take a number of steps before they could enter into a grant agreement with HUD and begin expending funds. Grantees were required to document their financial controls, procurement processes, and grant management procedures (including those for preventing the duplication of benefits, ensuring timely expenditures, and preventing and detecting fraud, waste, and abuse). By the end of September 2018, HUD had certified that all four grantees had proficient financial controls, procurement processes, and grant management procedures. Grantees were also required to submit an action plan for disaster recovery that includes an assessment of unmet needs for housing, infrastructure, and economic revitalization. The purpose of these unmet needs assessments was to help grantees understand the type and location of community needs and to target their CDBG-DR funds to those areas with the greatest need. HUD's review of the 2017 grantees' initial steps was limited, and it has not developed a comprehensive monitoring plan for these grants. HUD determined that the 2017 CDBG-DR grants posed high risk due to the size of the grants, but did not have a comprehensive plan to monitor these grants. HUD had not identified any unique risk factors associated with the 2017 grants that required additional attention. For example, HUD had not analyzed the potential risk of awarding a large grant to an entity that had little or no experience administering",

DOE's Loan Guarantee Program (LGP) was established in 2005 to help companies obtain financing for innovative technologies. The act also authorizes DOE to provide loan guarantees for projects that avoid, reduce, or sequester air pollutants or man-made emissions of greenhouse gases. GAO was asked to review DOE's funding for advanced fossil energy R&D projects. This report describes (1) DOE's funding of advanced fossil energy R&D projects started from fiscal years 2010 through 2017 and the types of projects and recipients that received funding, and (2) DOE's loan guarantees, if any, for advanced fossil energy projects from fiscal year 2006 through August 2018. GAO analyzed DOE advanced fossil energy R&D project data for fiscal years 2010 through 2017, reviewed relevant laws, regulations, and DOE guidance, and interviewed DOE officials. What GAO Found The Department of Energy (DOE) provided $2.66 billion in funding for 794 advanced fossil energy research and development (R&D) projects started from fiscal years 2010 through 2017. These 794 projects included 9 later-stage large demonstration projects and 785 other advanced fossil energy R&D projects. DOE provided $1.12 billion in funding to nine large demonstration projects aimed at demonstrating the commercial viability of CCS technologies. DOE provided $1.54 billion in funding to 785 other R&D projects for both coal and oil and gas technologies, mostly to universities and industry, located in 46 states and the District of Columbia. For nine large demonstration projects, DOE provided $1.12 billion in funding. These projects received that funding from appropriations from the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Recovery Act) and supported efforts to reduce the financial and technical risks of commercial CCS. Six demonstration projects researched CCS technologies using coal, while three used other fuels, namely methane, ethanol, and petcoke. Recipients were generally required to provide a certain percentage of the cost of each R&D project, called cost share. Specifically, to receive funding, recipients of funding for the nine large demonstration projects agreed to pay at least $610 million in cost share for the demonstration projects. Three of those demonstration projects remained active at the end of fiscal year 2017. Four projects had",

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA), within the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), and USDA are responsible for ensuring the safety and quality of rice and for assessing the human health effects of ingestion of arsenic in rice. GAO was asked to review the risk of arsenic in rice. This report examines (1) what NRC and recent key scientific reviews have reported about the effects of ingestion of arsenic on human health, (2) the extent to which FDA and USDA have managed the risk to human health from arsenic in rice, and (3) the extent to which FDA has coordinated with USDA and other federal agencies on actions to manage the risk. GAO analyzed NRC and key scientific reviews, reviewed relevant laws, regulations, and policies, and interviewed agency officials and stakeholders. What GAO Found The National Research Council (NRC) and recent key scientific reviews reported evidence of associations between long-term ingestion of arsenic and adverse human health effects. NRC identified stronger evidence of these associations at higher arsenic levels\u2014defined by NRC as 100 parts per billion (ppb) or higher in drinking water\u2014than at lower levels, which are more common in the United States. NRC reported greater uncertainty regarding the associations with some health effects at lower levels of arsenic and noted that research on the health effects of ingestion of lower levels of arsenic is ongoing. FDA and USDA have taken actions to manage the risk to human health from arsenic in rice, including assessing the type and prevalence of health effects that may result from long-term ingestion. These efforts were generally consistent with the six essential elements for managing risk, which GAO has found could help agencies assess threats that could affect the achievement of their goals. FDA has taken actions that were consistent with five of the six essential elements, including aligning risk management process with goals and objectives, identifying risks, assessing risks, responding to the risks, and monitoring risks. However, FDA has not fully taken action on the sixth element of communicating and reporting on risks. FDA issued a risk assessment in 2016 for public comment and a draft guidance limiting the levels of arsenic in infant rice cereal, but it has not updated or finalized these key documents.

In April 2016, BP, the federal government, and the five Gulf Coast states agreed to a settlement resolving multiple claims for federal civil penalties and natural resource damages related to the spill totaling up to $14.9 billion. GAO was asked to review the restoration efforts of the federal and state governments after the Deepwater Horizon oil spill. This report examines (1) how the federal and state governments used the restoration trust funds for the Exxon Valdez and Deepwater Horizon oil spills and the status of the restoration efforts; (2) the status of the interagency committee's oil spill research efforts and how coordination of such efforts has changed since GAO last reported on it in March 2011; and (3) what literature suggests about the effectiveness of various oil spill response techniques in the Arctic and the Gulf of Mexico. GAO reviewed relevant laws and regulations, and analyzed financial data from the federal and state governments and the interagency committee. GAO also interviewed officials from the 15 member agencies that fund oil spill research and the interagency committee. What GAO Found In response to the Exxon Valdez and Deepwater Horizon oil spills and by forming trustee councils, federal and state governments have used the restoration trust funds to authorize money for activities in accordance with approved restoration plans. The Exxon Valdez Trustee Council has largely completed restoration work and authorized approximately $985 million, roughly 86 percent of the restoration trust fund, primarily on habitat protection and general restoration, research, and monitoring activities. As a result of these restoration activities and natural recovery, the majority of the injured natural resources and human services in the spill area has recovered or is recovering, according to the council's assessment. However, the Exxon Valdez Trustee Council continues to monitor the lack of recovery of Pacific herring and the presence of lingering oil in the spill area. The Deepwater Horizon Trustee Council is completing early restoration work and initial post-settlement restoration planning. It has authorized approximately $1.1 billion for restoration activities, roughly 13 percent of the restoration trust fund, and spent $368 million, roughly 5 percent of the restoration trust fund, primarily on habitat protection and enhancing recreation, such",

In response, countries have used strategies, including increasing the statutory retirement age of their national pension systems, to reduce that pressure. However, many workers continue to leave the workforce prior to reaching the statutory retirement age. GAO was asked to review the experiences of other countries with phased retirement programs. This report examines (1) the extent to which phased retirement exists in other countries with aging populations, (2) the key aspects of phased retirement programs in selected countries, and (3) the experiences that other countries have had in providing phased retirement and how that can inform the U.S. experience. GAO reviewed relevant literature and interviewed officials and experts in four countries with a national pension system similar to social security and an aging population. GAO also reviewed relevant research and interviewed officials and experts in four countries. What GAO Found Among the 44 countries that met GAO's initial criteria as having a national pension system similar to social security and an aging population, GAO identified 17 with some kind of phased retirement program. Among the 17 countries, the national policies implemented in the four countries were generally designed to encourage older workers to remain in the labor force and continue to earn and contribute to their pensions, and often, share their institutional knowledge with younger workers. For example, in Germany, workers participating in a national phased retirement program can reduce their work hours by 50 percent, and in Sweden, workers participating in a public phased retirement program can reduce their work hours by 80 percent. The four countries employed various efforts at the national level to encourage phased retirement, including implementing national policies and programs that involve public subsidies, tax incentives, or changing pension rules to allow individuals to receive partial pension benefits while continuing to accrue benefits in the same pension plan. Even with unique considerations for the United States, the experiences of other countries with phased retirement could inform U.S. efforts to provide phased retirement. Institutional and employer-specific factors in other countries, which shape the design of phased retirement programs, typically differ from the institutional environment experienced by many U.S. private sector employers, although they may be similar to those common in U.S. public sector employment. Some of these institutional factors include the extent to which employers and workers are supported by universal health insurance, whether the programs are structured around",

GAO was asked to review SSA's disability decisions. This report examines (1) the extent to which allowance rates vary across judges, and any factors that are associated with this variation, and (2) the extent to which SSA has processes to monitor the accuracy and consistency of hearings decisions. GAO analyzed SSA data on disability decisions made by judges from fiscal years 2007 through 2015, and interviewed SSA officials and experts. GAO also analyzed a nongeneralizable sample of 3.3 million decisions made by judges from fiscal years 2007 through 2015, and reviewed relevant federal laws and literature. What GAO Found GAO analyzed about 3.3 million decisions made by administrative law judges on adult disability appeals from fiscal years 2007 through 2015, and found that allowance rates varied across judges and hearing offices. GAO estimated that the average allowance rate for a typical claim heard by a judge with low allowance rates would be 42 percent, compared to 88 percent for a judge with high allowance rates. This variation in allowance rates persisted, but fell modestly over time, even when GAO used multivariate statistical methods to hold constant a variety of factors related to the disability appeals process. These factors included characteristics of claimants, judges, and hearing offices, as well as other factors such as the unemployment rates in a claimant's state, that could otherwise explain differences in allowance rates. SSA officials noted that the variation in allowance rates GAO observed across judges was not surprising, nor was the modest narrowing in this range over time. SSA officials said that the variation in allowance rates was not surprising, nor was the modest narrowing in this range over time. SSA officials said that SSA began conducting quality assurance reviews of a random sample of allowances in 2011\u2014formerly, such cases were not reviewed. SSA officials said that SSA's disability programs and administrative law judges were under increased public and Congressional scrutiny following a high-profile fraud case in 2011 involving a judge and an attorney representative.

The act also includes a provision for GAO to assess the extent to which there were variations in: (1) the number of regulations and other indicators related to the scope and transparency of these regulations; (2) agencies' reported compliance with procedural requirements for promulgating the regulations; and (3) the anticipated economic effects agencies reported would result from the regulations. GAO analyzed the universe of all 527 final economically significant regulations published during the specified time periods and a generalizable stratified random sample of 358 final significant regulations from the population of the 1,633 final significant regulations published during those same periods. GAO also reviewed the published regulations and, for regulations that were also major rules, major rule reports prepared for Congress under the Congressional Review Act (CRA). GAO also reviewed the published regulations and, for regulations that were also major rules, major rule reports prepared for Congress under CRA. What GAO Found The three administrations published a higher number of economically significant and significant final regulations at the end of each President's second term compared to the nontransition periods. The administrations published on average roughly 2.5 times more economically significant regulations during their transition periods than during nontransition periods. GAO's analysis also showed that within their transition periods (September 23 through January 20), the administrations of Presidents Clinton and Obama increased their rate of economically significant rulemaking following the elections held in 2000 and 2016 (between Election Day in November and January 20), while President Bush's administration decreased the rate of economically significant rulemaking following the 2008 election. GAO found that the majority of economically significant regulations were published by a subset of agencies across the three administrations and between transition and nontransition periods. For significant regulations, GAO found that a higher percentage of regulations appeared in the previous spring's Unified Agenda compared to President Clinton's transition period. However, GAO found no statistical differences between the nontransition periods combined and any of the three transition periods. Nearly all economically significant",

State's Foreign Service employees serve in a variety of functions at overseas posts, including consular, economic, management, political, and public diplomacy. GAO was asked to review State's Foreign Service vacancies. This report examines (1) vacancies in State's Foreign Service staffing at overseas posts, (2) reported effects of Foreign Service vacancies on diplomatic readiness, and (3) State's efforts to address Foreign Service vacancies. GAO analyzed State's personnel data on Foreign Service staffing at overseas posts from the department's Global Employment Management System (GEMS), as of March 2018, and interviewed State officials in Washington, D.C., and overseas posts. What GAO Found According to State data, the number of both staffed and vacant overseas Foreign Service positions increased between 2008 and 2018. Despite the increase in the number of positions staffed, GAO's analysis found that as of March 31, 2018, overall, 13 percent of State's overseas Foreign Service positions were vacant. This vacancy percentage is similar to the percentages of vacancies in overseas Foreign Service positions that GAO reported in 2012 and 2008. According to State officials, State's ability to hire Foreign Service employees to fill persistent vacancies has been affected by factors such as reduced appropriations. State's data show persistent vacancies in Foreign Service generalist positions that support and maintain the functioning of overseas posts. Among the 10 largest Foreign Service specialist skill groups, security officer, office management specialist, and information management had the largest percentages of vacant positions\u201416 percent, 16 percent, and 14 percent, respectively\u2014as of March 31, 2018. State officials said that State has had difficulty recruiting and hiring Foreign Service employees to fill specialist positions in some skill groups at overseas posts. Vacancies in Foreign Service specialist positions at overseas posts present additional challenges because specialized skills and competencies are often required to perform the work of these positions. Vacancies in Foreign Service specialist positions at overseas posts have adversely affected State's diplomatic readiness. Among Foreign Service generalist career tracks, the political and economic career tracks had the two largest percentages of vacant positions\u201420 percent and 16 percent, respectively\u2014as of March 31, 2018. Vacancies in these positions have adversely affected State's diplomatic readiness. Among Foreign Service generalist career tracks, the political and economic career tracks",
    "gao_GAO-18-447": "Why GAO Did This Study The Army's Patriot system is a mobile surface-to-air missile system designed to counter tactical ballistic missiles, cruise missiles, and other threats such as airplanes, helicopters, and unmanned aerial vehicles. The Army's reset and recapitalization processes are two of the primary processes the Army uses to maintain the Patriot system. GAO was asked to review the Army's reset and recapitalization processes. This report examines the extent to which the Army's reset process supports the timely delivery of Patriot equipment back to units, and the Army's plans for supporting the long-term viability of the Patriot system through recapitalization and any challenges associated with its plans. GAO analyzed Army documents and interviewed officials from the Army, the Army's depot, and other organizations involved in the sustainment of the Patriot system. What GAO Found The Army's reset process\u2014which seeks to bring equipment returning from the U.S. Central Command area of responsibility back to Army standards\u2014has often been delayed, affecting units' ability to schedule and execute training as they prepare for their next mission. From fiscal years 2014 through 2017, the Army reset seven battalions and for six of these battalions, the Army did not return all of the units' equipment within 180 days. Two of these battalions\u2014the 2-43 Air Defense Artillery and 4-3 Air Defense Artillery\u2014experienced delays that were deliberately planned. Specifically, Army officials told GAO that the installation of system upgrades for these battalions extended the overall reset timeline by 60 days. However, of the remaining five Patriot units that completed reset during the period GAO reviewed, only one received all of its returned equipment within 180 days. The Army has identified several factors that affect the timeliness of Patriot maintenance, but has not conducted an analysis to identify their relative importance. Some of the factors affecting timeliness are directly within the control of the Army's Letterkenny Army Depot (Letterkenny), where reset is conducted, and some are not. Specifically, Army officials stated that U.S. Transportation Command and the Defense Logistics Agency also have responsibilities related to some of the factors that can affect timeliness, such as the transport of equipment and availability of parts, respectively. Although aware of the challenges in returning equipment to units in a timely manner, the Army has not comprehensively analyzed the relative importance of the",
    "gao_GAO-19-147T": "Why GAO Did This Study The Coast Guard and NOAA continue investing taxpayer dollars to modernize their fleets, but they could benefit from the lessons learned from prior recapitalization and acquisition efforts. This testimony discusses (1) the extent to which the Coast Guard and NOAA have developed strategic and comprehensive approaches for managing their respective portfolios, (2) the extent to which the Coast Guard and NOAA have leveraged the Navy's shipbuilding experience, and (3) the extent to which the Coast Guard and NOAA have selected contracting mechanisms to manage their acquisitions. This statement is based on GAO's September 2018 report, Coast Guard: Leveraging Navy's Shipbuilding Experience Could Create Efficiencies (GAO-2018-02-28). GAO reviewed relevant laws, regulations, and guidance; analyzed agency documents; and interviewed agency officials. What GAO Found Key elements of strategic planning include establishing long-term goals and strategies for how those goals are to be achieved. Specifically for managing Coast Guard acquisitions, GAO has noted that a long-term plan that includes acquisition implications would enable tradeoffs to be addressed in advance, which leads to better informed choices and makes debate possible before irreversible commitments are made to individual programs. Without this type of plan, decision makers do not have the information they need to better understand and address an agency's long-term outlook. Similarly, according to the Office of Management and Budget's capital planning guidance referenced by the Coast Guard's Major Systems Acquisition Manual, each agency is encouraged to have a plan that justifies its long-term capital asset decisions. In June 2014, GAO found that the Coast Guard\u2014a component within the Department of Homeland Security (DHS)\u2014did not have a long-term fleet modernization plan that identified all acquisitions needed to meet mission needs over the next two decades within available resources. Without such a plan, the Coast Guard repeatedly delayed and reduced its capabilities through its annual budget process and did not know the extent to which it could meet mission needs and achieve desired results. GAO recommended that the Coast Guard develop a 20-year fleet modernization plan that identifies all acquisitions needed to maintain the current level of service and the fiscal resources necessary to build the identified assets. DHS concurred with GAO's recommendation but it has not yet approved a 20-year plan. Further, in July 2018, GAO found the Coast Guard continues to manage its",
    "gao_GAO-19-131": "Why GAO Did This Study The federal government invests billions of dollars in IT annually, and these investments often fail or incur cost overruns and schedule slippages, while contributing little to mission-related outcomes. The act included specific provisions related to seven areas, including the following: (1) CIO authority enhancements\u2014Covered agencies' CIOs are required to (1) approve the IT budget requests of their respective agencies, (2) certify that agencies' IT investments are adequately implementing Office of Management and Budget's incremental development guidance, (3) review and approve contracts for IT, and (4) approve the appointment of other agency employees with the title of CIO (e.g., component agency CIOs). GAO has previously reported that the federal government has spent billions of dollars on failed IT investments. In 2014, FITARA was also intended to improve agencies' acquisitions of IT and facilitate Congress' efforts to monitor agencies' progress and hold them accountable for reducing duplication and achieving cost savings. GAO was asked to review the act's implementation. This report examines the extent to which selected agencies have implemented the act's provisions and identified practices that have helped them achieve cost savings and other IT management improvements. GAO reviewed relevant laws, guidance, and OMB guidance; analyzed agency documentation; and interviewed agency officials. What GAO Found The nine selected agencies identified a total of 12 practices that helped them successfully implement the Federal Information Technology Acquisition Reform Act (FITARA) provisions considered in GAO's review. Among the practices, a number of the agencies identified four that were overarching\u2014that is, the practices were not unique to a specific provision, but, instead, better positioned agencies to implement the five provisions selected for GAO's review. For example, Commerce and the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) established internal performance measures for their component agencies that officials believe have led to increased effectiveness in implementing FITARA. In addition, Commerce and DHS established policies to explain how the specific authorities that FITARA provided to the agency CIO are to be carried out. As a result of implementing these practices, each of the agencies was better positioned to implement FITARA. For example, Commerce established a policy to ensure that the CIO certified major IT investments as adequately implementing incremental development. DHS established a policy to ensure that the department-level CIO certified major IT investments as adequately implementing",
    "gao_GAO-18-123": "Why GAO Did This Study RAD is a federal program that allows public housing agencies (PHAs) to convert units from public housing to other rental assistance programs. The RAD program is authorized by Congress and signed into law by the President in November 2011 under the Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act, 2012 with amendments in 2014, 2015, 2016, and 2017. The RAD program is intended to preserve the affordability of federally assisted rental properties and improve their physical and financial condition. GAO was asked to review RAD conversions. This report examines (1) HUD's assessment of the physical and financial outcomes of RAD conversion to date; (2) how RAD conversions affected residents and what safeguards were in place to protect them, including while temporarily relocated and during conversion; (3) what challenges, if any, PHAs faced in implementing RAD; and (4) the extent to which RAD provisions are designed to help preserve the long-term affordability of units. GAO analyzed HUD data on RAD conversions since fiscal year 2013 through 2017 and interviewed HUD officials and selected stakeholders, including developers and resident advocacy groups. What GAO Found The Department of Housing and Urban Development's (HUD) Rental Assistance Demonstration (RAD) program involves some type of construction, but its leveraging and construction metrics are limited. GAO's analysis of HUD data showed that 417 of 689 closed RAD conversions (61 percent) involved planned rehabilitation to the property, 86 (12 percent) new construction, and 186 (27 percent) no construction. HUD officials stated that they approve conversions that involve no immediate planned rehabilitation or new construction as long as the property has no immediate needs to be addressed. Such conversions allow PHAs to better position themselves to access additional capital to address future rehabilitation or construction plans. HUD's RAD leverage ratio, published in May 2017, does not accurately reflect the amount of private-sector leveraging achieved through RAD. For example, HUD's calculation does not include all sources that were federally appropriated or contributed by PHAs, potentially under- or over-reporting the program's performance. Additionally, HUD's calculation does not include all sources that were federally appropriated or contributed by PHAs, potentially under- or over-reporting the program's performance.

    "gao_GAO-18-269": "Why GAO Did This Study The exchanges (including the FFE and those operated by individual states) provide a seamless, single point of access for eligible individuals to enroll in qualified health plans. Issuers are responsible for, among other things, collecting premiums from enrollees, arranging for coverage through provider networks, and paying claims. Issuers have raised concerns that the SEP regulations potentially allow individuals to enroll in coverage despite having their coverage terminated for nonpayment of premiums. GAO was asked to review the FFE exchange. This report examines (1) demographic and coverage characteristics of FFE enrollees that maintained continuous coverage throughout 2015, and (2) the extent to which CMS has data on terminations of enrollee coverage due to nonpayment of premiums. GAO analyzed data from CMS's centralized enrollment system and from issuers, which are the insurers that issue individuals' health plans. GAO also interviewed CMS officials and issuers. What GAO Found About 4.9 million federally facilitated exchange (FFE) enrollees maintained continuous coverage throughout 2015, with an average length of coverage of 11.6 months. Most of these enrollees (83 percent) re-enrolled in coverage by June 2016. The remaining 4.3 million enrollees (47 percent) did not maintain continuous FFE coverage throughout the year, as defined above. The average length of coverage for these enrollees was about 5.0 months and, for most (72 percent), coverage ended prior to the end of the year. Enrollees with certain characteristics tended to remain covered for a longer period of time in 2015 compared to other enrollees. For example, enrollees who enrolled during the open enrollment period had a higher average length of coverage than enrollees who enrolled through an SEP\u20149.1 months compared to 5.2 months. However, more individuals who enrolled through an SEP remained enrolled through December 31, 2015, compared to individuals who enrolled during open enrollment\u201472 percent compared to 64 percent. CMS's data on terminations of enrollee coverage due to nonpayment of premiums are not complete and accurate.

The Coast Guard is responsible for acquiring and maintaining assets, such as patrol boats, to support its missions. The Coast Guard has a history of using its annual budgets to plan its acquisition portfolio, which leads to ever changing priorities and creates deferred acquisitions and a bow wave of future funding requirements. This bow wave has begun and the Coast Guard will continue to add to it until it begins to have a longer-term focus, such as with the creation of the 20-year Long Term Major Acquisition Plan that GAO recommended in 2014. This testimony discusses (1) the challenges the Coast Guard faces in effectively managing its acquisition portfolio and (2) the extent to which the Coast Guard is addressing sustainment challenges for its heavy polar icebreaker and 270-foot medium endurance cutters. This statement is based on GAO's July 2018 report on the Coast Guard's heavy polar icebreaker program and its heavy polar icebreaker acquisition, and selected updates conducted in July 2018. GAO also reviewed Coast Guard documents and interviewed Coast Guard officials. What GAO Found The Coast Guard faces challenges in effectively managing its acquisition portfolio. In September 2012, GAO found that the Coast Guard's approach of relying on the annual budget process and the 5-year Capital Investment Plan to manage portfolio affordability does not provide the best basis for making decisions to develop a more balanced and affordable portfolio in the long term. Further, in June 2014, GAO found that there is no evidence that short-term budget decisions will result in a good long-term strategy, and the Coast Guard's annual budget-driven trade-off approach creates constant churn as program baselines must continually re-align with budget realities instead of budgets being formulated to support program baselines. This situation results in trade-off decisions between capability and cost being pushed into the future. For example, since 2010, the Coast Guard has a stated requirement for three medium polar icebreakers, but it has only one operational medium icebreaker, the Healy, which has an expected end of service life\u2014the total period for which an asset is designed to operate\u2014in 2029. Despite the requirement for three medium polar icebreakers, Coast Guard officials said they are not currently assessing acquisition of",

TSA has also developed the NCSP Recognition Program, which compares foreign air cargo security programs and assesses them to determine if they provide a level of security that is commensurate with TSA's air cargo security requirements. GAO was asked to review TSA's efforts to secure U.S.-bound air cargo. This report describes steps TSA takes to help ensure that U.S.-bound air cargo is secure, describes the status of TSA's efforts to recognize and monitor foreign governments' air cargo security programs, and analyzes the extent to which TSA measures the effectiveness of its efforts to secure U.S.-bound air cargo. GAO reviewed relevant laws and regulations, TSA's air carrier inspection and foreign airport assessments data, and TSA's NCSP recognition program documents and met with TSA and foreign government officials in two countries selected based on their air carrier operations and the volume of U.S.-bound air cargo. What GAO Found To help ensure compliance with cargo security requirements and international standards, the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) inspects air carriers and assesses certain known consignors and regulated agents. TSA also inspects cargo security procedures during foreign airport assessments. Further, DHS has implemented requirements to obtain advance information on air cargo shipments through the Advanced Cargo Information System (ACAS), which it uses to perform targeted risk assessments. As of June 2018, TSA had recognized the passenger air cargo security programs of the European Union and 12 other countries and monitored their implementation. TSA has taken steps to broadly measure the effectiveness of its air carrier inspections and foreign airport assessments, but these efforts do not allow TSA to specifically determine the effectiveness of the cargo portions of such inspections or assessments. For example, TSA has not evaluated the effectiveness of its air carrier cargo inspections or the cargo portions of foreign airport assessments. Further, TSA has not developed performance measures for determining the effectiveness of its NCSP Recognition Program. Specifically, TSA has not evaluated the effectiveness of its air carrier cargo inspections or the cargo portions of foreign airport assessments. For example, TSA has not developed a",

The ACV program is being developed as a partial or full replacement for the AAV, which is a tracked (non-wheeled) vehicle with capability to launch from ships to reach the shore carrying up to 21 Marines at a speed of up to approximately 6 knots. In order to upgrade the AAV to meet current threats and establish a path toward an enhanced platform, DOD and the Marine Corps implemented an incremental approach. The first step was to improve the AAVs' protection from threats such as improvised explosive devices by installing enhanced armor and other equipment\u2014referred to as survivability upgrades\u2014efforts which are currently underway. The second step was to establish a plan to replace the AAV with a new vehicle, the ACV, which would develop and enhance capabilities in three incremental steps: ACV 1.1 would be a wheeled vehicle that provides improved protected land mobility but limited amphibious capability. The ACV program plans to produce at least 208 vehicles after exercising contract options for 2 years of low-rate production of 30 vehicles each year starting in 2018 and then exercise options for 2 years of full-rate production for the remaining 148 or more vehicles starting in 2020. The ACV program is currently in the process of determining if the program is on track to meet the criteria to enter production, but program officials told GAO the Navy\u2014which has the authority to approve major acquisition milestone decisions for the program\u2014may choose to start low-rate production without meeting established best practices for manufacturing maturity. GAO has previously identified the ACV program as adopting an aggressive acquisition schedule in which the amount of concurrent developmental testing and production is more than typical acquisition programs. In fiscal year 2018, Congress authorized funding for the program to start production, but the decision to enter a second year of low-rate production and the decision to start full-rate production represent opportunities for the ACV program to verify the manufacturer has achieved a sufficient level of readiness before commencing production of the bulk of vehicles.

Section 911 also requires GAO to report on DOD's efforts to implement section 911. This report examines the extent to which DOD's draft organizational strategy addresses statutory elements and incorporates leading practices for effective cross-functional teams. GAO reviewed DOD's draft organizational strategy, analyzed relevant literature, and interviewed DOD officials. What GAO Found The Department of Defense's (DOD) draft organizational strategy addresses two statutory elements required under section 911 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2017\u2014identifying critical objectives and outputs that would benefit from the use of cross-functional teams, and providing for the appropriate use of these teams\u2014but DOD has not issued that strategy as required by September 1, 2017. In addition, while the draft strategy contains the two required elements, it does not outline how DOD will achieve several future outcomes required under section 911 of the NDAA for Fiscal Year 2017 that are designed to advance a collaborative culture within the department. Further, ODCMO officials did not coordinate with key stakeholders, such as the Secretary of Defense, military departments, and defense agencies, in developing the organizational strategy. GAO's leading practices for collaboration highlight the value of agencies including stakeholders when defining and articulating a common outcome. DOD has established one Secretary of Defense-empowered cross-functional team, and draft guidance addresses most statutory elements and incorporates leading practices for effective cross-functional teams. DOD's draft guidance fully addresses six and partially addresses one of the section 911 required statutory elements. GAO also found that DOD's draft guidance partially addresses two leading practices, partially addresses two leading practices, and does not address one leading practice for effective cross-functional teams. DOD has developed, but not provided, training for its presidential appointees and cross-functional team members, and it does not address all statutory requirements. As of October 2017, 22 individuals have been nominated by the President, confirmed by the Senate, and appointed to positions within the Office of the Secretary of Defense, but none have received training required by section 911.

This report examines (1) the extent to which selected VAMCs' reviews of providers' clinical care are documented and timely, and (2) the extent to which selected VAMCs report providers to the NPDB and SLBs in accordance with VHA policy. GAO reviewed VHA policy and guidance, interviewed VA officials, and analyzed data from VHA's National Provider Data Bank (NPDB). GAO also reviewed relevant federal laws and regulations, and interviewed VA officials. What GAO Found GAO found that the five selected VAMCs collectively required reviews of 148 providers' clinical care after concerns were raised from October 2013 through March 2017, but VAMC officials were unable to provide documentation that almost half of these reviews were conducted. GAO also found that all five VAMCs lacked at least some documentation of the reviews they told GAO they conducted, and in some cases the required reviews were not conducted at all. GAO also found that VHA does not adequately oversee VAMC reviews of providers' clinical care after concerns have been raised, including ensuring that these reviews are completed and documented in a timely manner.

In February 2017, GAO updated its High Risk List to include 61 areas that are high risk due to their vulnerability to mismanagement or that are most in need of transformation. This statement discusses (1) actions taken by the agencies to address management weaknesses that led to the 2017 High Risk designation and (2) the status of the agencies' efforts to address management weaknesses that led to the 2017 High Risk designation. This statement is based on GAO's prior work and updates information from the High Risk List. GAO reviewed agency documents and interviewed agency officials. What GAO Found The Departments of Indian Affairs, Energy (DOE), Health and Human Services (HHS), and Housing and Urban Development (HUD) have made some progress in addressing management weaknesses that led to the 2017 High Risk designation for federal management of programs that serve tribes and their members. However, additional progress is needed for the agencies to fully address the criteria and related management weaknesses, particularly in the areas of leadership commitment and capacity. For example, Indian Affairs' leaders have demonstrated commitment to addressing key weaknesses in the management of BIE schools. However, Indian Affairs has not yet demonstrated leadership commitment to addressing key weaknesses in the management of BIE schools. Further, BIA officials reported to GAO that the agency does not have the people and resources needed to fully implement other recommendations. GAO also found that BIA and IHS have made some progress in identifying actions to address many of GAO's recommendations, but additional progress is needed for the agencies to fully address the criteria and related management weaknesses, particularly in the areas of leadership commitment and capacity. For example, Indian Affairs has made some progress in implementing corrective actions in education as demonstrated by GAO's closure of nearly a third of its recommendations directed to Indian Affairs related to education programs.

    "gao_GAO-18-48": "Why GAO Did This Study Misconduct can occur in any workplace. When misconduct occurs, an agency may incur a number of direct and indirect costs depending on how the agency chooses to address misconduct. GAO was asked to examine the process for addressing misconduct and to identify any challenges in removing employees for misconduct. This report (1) describes the process that agencies are generally required to follow in responding to employee misconduct in the federal service; (2) identifies alternative approaches to the formal legal process that agencies can use to respond to misconduct, and assess what factors affect agencies' responses; (3) describes trends in removals and other adverse actions resulting from misconduct; and (4) identifies key steps agencies can take to help them better prevent and address misconduct. GAO reviewed relevant statutes, regulations, and other documents; analyzed OPM data from fiscal years 2006 to 2016 on misconduct removals and adverse actions resulting from misconduct; and interviewed OPM officials and subject-matter experts. What GAO Found Most agencies are required to follow statutory and regulatory procedures when taking adverse actions against an employee for misconduct. The Merit Systems Protection Board (MSPB) and Office of Personnel Management (OPM) regulations specify the process agencies must pursue to take adverse actions. Subchapter I of Chapter 75 describes the requirements for (1) non-appealable adverse actions such as suspensions of 14 days or less or (2) appealable adverse actions such as reductions in pay or grade, suspensions of more than 14 days, and removals. Subchapter II of Chapter 75 describes the steps agencies must take to address more significant cases of employee misconduct than those addressed under Subchapter I. Agencies may use alternative discipline approaches, such as community service, to address misconduct. However, several factors can affect whether and how an agency responds to misconduct. For example, supervisors may not report misconduct due to fear that an employee could counter with their own complaint. Several Chief Human Capital Officers (CHCO) and subject-matter experts GAO interviewed said that supervisors may not report misconduct due to fear that an employee could counter with their own complaint. Several CHCOs and subject-matter experts said that an agency's approach to dealing with misconduct can influence how first-line supervisors act.

The Bureau plans to use IT to drive innovation, such as re-engineering field operations, using administrative records, verifying addresses in-office, and developing an Internet self-response option. This statement discusses the Bureau's plans for 2020 and the challenges it faces in implementing these innovations. This statement is based on GAO's ongoing work on the Bureau's plans for 2020 and ongoing work on the Bureau's information technology (IT) systems. GAO reviewed Bureau documents and interviewed Bureau officials. What GAO Found The U.S. Census Bureau (Bureau) plans to use four key innovation areas for 2020: (1) re-engineering field operations, (2) using administrative records, (3) verifying addresses in-office, and (4) developing an Internet self-response option. The Bureau has estimated that these innovations could result in savings of over $5 billion (in 2020 dollars) when compared to its estimates of the cost for conducting the census with traditional methods. However, the innovations also introduce new risks, in part, because they include new procedures and technology that have not been used extensively in earlier decennials, if at all. For example, in May 2017, the Bureau scaled back the operational scope of the 2018 End-to-End Test and, of the three planned test sites, only the Rhode Island site would fully implement the 2018 End-to-End Test. Without sufficient testing, operational problems can go undiscovered and the opportunity to improve operations will be lost, in part because the 2018 End-to-End Test is the last opportunity to demonstrate census technology and procedures across a range of geographic locations, housing types, and demographic groups. The Bureau has fundamentally re-engineered its approach to building its master address list for 2020. Specifically, by relying on multiple sources of imagery and administrative data, the Bureau anticipates constructing its address list with far less door-to-door field canvassing compared to previous censuses.

    "gao_GAO-18-207": "Why GAO Did This Study SBA and the 11 participating agencies have awarded billions of dollars to small businesses to help them develop and commercialize innovative technologies. The Small Business Act requires agencies to evaluate whether small businesses have met a minimum performance standard for commercializing their technology. SBA and the participating agencies assess small businesses against the benchmarks and identify those that do not meet the benchmarks. GAO was asked to review SBA's and the participating agencies' efforts to implement the benchmarks. This report examines (1) the extent to which SBA and the participating agencies have assessed small businesses against the benchmarks and provided information to small businesses about the consequence of not meeting the benchmarks, and (2) the extent to which SBA and the participating agencies have provided information to small businesses about the consequence of not meeting the benchmarks. GAO reviewed SBA and the participating agencies' policies and procedures and interviewed SBA and participating agency officials. What GAO Found Data challenges have limited the Small Business Administration's (SBA) and the 11 participating agencies' efforts to fully implement the Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) and Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) programs. Since 2014, SBA and the participating agencies have regularly assessed small businesses against the Transition Rate Benchmark, which, in general, measures the rate at which businesses move projects from phase I to phase II. However, GAO found instances in which the data used to generate the list of small businesses subject to the benchmark changed considerably after SBA's initial assessment, indicating that the data used for that assessment were inaccurate. SBA officials told GAO that the quality of the award information in the database has been an issue, and that accurate information is important because small businesses may avoid being identified as subject to the benchmark if their business names and identification numbers are different across multiple records. SBA and the participating agencies do not know the extent to which small businesses are meeting the Commercialization Benchmark because SBA and the participating agencies have assessed businesses against the benchmark only once, in 2014, when SBA determined that 12 businesses did not meet the benchmark. This is in part because, according to officials from SBA and several agencies, they cannot collect and verify the accuracy of the data needed to implement the benchmark as written. For SBA and the participating agencies to assess whether small businesses meet the Commercialization Benchmark, these small businesses must provide data on sales, investments, or patents resulting from the awards. However, agency officials told G",
    "gao_GAO-19-211": "Why GAO Did This Study DOD's base budget is the largest source of funding for OCO activities. Congress provides most of the OCO amounts for DOD in its operation and maintenance (O&M) account. The National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2018 included a provision for GAO to review DOD's OCO and base funding processes. This report describes DOD's use of internal controls to separately account for OCO and base amounts in its O&M accounts during budget execution. GAO reviewed documentation of DOD's internal controls and interviewed DOD officials. GAO also reviewed relevant literature and interviewed DOD and congressional officials. What GAO Found The Department of Defense (DOD) components in GAO's review use coding and other internal control activities to separately account for overseas contingency operations (OCO) and base amounts in their O&M accounts during budget execution. To record and track OCO and base amounts separately, the DOD components use coding in their financial systems during the allotment, obligation, and disbursement of funds. For example, during the allotment phase, the Army and the Defense Security Cooperation Agency use codes in their financial systems to divide, distribute, and track their appropriated funds into separate categories\u2014including one for OCO and one for base. DOD components in GAO's review have put into place internal control activities to ensure separate accounting of OCO and base amounts, such as controls over information processing. GAO identified at least four alternatives to the processes Congress and DOD use to separate funding for DOD's OCO and base activities. Each alternative would require action at different phases of DOD's budget process and entail tradeoffs. For example, each alternative would require action at different phases of DOD's budget process and entail tradeoffs. For example, each alternative would require action at different phases of DOD's budget process and entail tradeoffs. For example, adding specific purpose language would better align obligation of OCO amounts with congressional intent; however, doing so could also reduce DOD's financial flexibility and responsiveness to changes in operations. Understanding the implications of each alternative is important to avoid unintended consequences.

    "gao_GAO-18-557": "Why GAO Did This Study DOD spends billions of dollars on airlift services, including airlift services for military personnel and cargo. The Air Force is responsible for providing airlift services to DOD and the Transportation Working Capital Fund (TWCF), which is dedicated to the Air Force. The TWCF is authorized to establish airlift customer rates to be competitive with commercial airlift carriers, which historically, do not result in revenue sufficient to cover the full cost of airlift operations. GAO was asked to review the TWCF. This report examines the extent to which (1) ARA funds were requested, allotted, and expended by the Air Force from fiscal years 2007 through 2017, and (2) TRANSCOM has implemented a process to set rates for airlift services and use workload forecasts to estimate the annual ARA funding request. GAO analyzed budget documents, budget requests, and other information from the Air Force and TRANSCOM for fiscal years 2007 through 2017. GAO also interviewed DOD, Air Force, and TRANSCOM officials. What GAO Found The Air Force requested, allotted, and expended billions of dollars for the Airlift Readiness Account (ARA) for fiscal years 2007 through 2017, and annual amounts varied. GAO's analysis of Air Force and TRANSCOM budget and financial information showed that for fiscal years 2007 through 2017, the Air Force requested $2.8 billion from Congress for ARA requirements, as part of its annual Operations and Maintenance appropriation. The Air Force allotted $2.8 billion (i.e., directed the use of the appropriated funds) and expended $2.4 billion of the ARA appropriated funds. During this period, the total allotted amount was about $400 million dollars more than the expended amount. According to Air Force officials, this $400 million was used to pay for other Air Force readiness priorities, such as training and sustainment requirements. ARA expenditures in the fiscal year of availability may be more or less than budgeted: For example, in fiscal year 2015, TRANSCOM did not receive revenue from other sources, resulting in the Air Force expending $404 million dollars more from its Operations and Maintenance funds than requested to cover the ARA bill for that fiscal year. On the other hand, in the fiscal year 2016 Air Force Operations and Maintenance budget request, the Air Force requested $657 million for the ARA, and subsequently allotted $406 million to the ARA\u2014about $251",

In September 2016, Congress appropriated $932 million to HHS and its agencies in the Zika Response and Preparedness Act. Of that amount, $394 million was appropriated directly to CDC and $152 million was appropriated directly to NIH. The remainder was appropriated to HHS's Public Health Services and Emergency Response Fund, from which HHS allocated $245 million to BARDA within the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response, $75 million to CMS, and $66 million to HRSA. GAO was asked to review the Zika supplemental funding. This report examines (1) the extent to which HHS and its agencies have obligated the Zika supplemental funding, and disbursements have ongoing, and (2) the activities selected awardees used with and managed the Zika supplemental funding. GAO reviewed relevant laws, regulations, and agency documents; interviewed agency officials; and conducted site visits to selected awardees in four states selected based on geographic location and other factors. What GAO Found As of September 30, 2017, the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) had obligated nearly all of the Zika supplemental funding appropriated by the Zika Response and Preparedness Act. HHS agencies had disbursed about 21 percent (approximately $195.5 million of $932 million) of the Zika supplemental funding. According to agency officials and selected awardees GAO spoke with, various factors can affect the disbursement of funding after obligation, such as time to draw down funding from the federal agencies, allowing for program implementation and a planning period, and awardees' internal administrative processes and unique characteristics. For example, some territories experienced delays in carrying out activities due to provider shortages, particularly among specialists needed to care for children with developmental delays and birth defects caused by the Zika virus. Selected awardees GAO spoke with used Zika supplemental funding for a variety of activities, including medical surveillance, vector control, laboratory capacity building, and providing health care services. Collectively, the activities included four primary types: medical surveillance, vector control, laboratory capacity building, and providing health care services. Selected awardees GAO spoke with reported positive experiences with the process of applying for and",

CHCO Council agencies are responsible for coordinating and coordinating the activities of member agencies on such matters as the modernization of human resources systems, improved quality of human resources information, and legislation affecting human resources operations and organizations. GAO was asked to review CHCO Council agencies' use of special payment authorities. This report (1) describes what is known about how much CHCO Council agencies used selected special payment authorities in fiscal years 2014-2016; (2) assesses the extent to which CHCO agencies evaluate the effectiveness of these authorities and identifies challenges, if any, the agencies reported facing in using the authorities to address mission-critical skills gap areas; and (3) evaluates how the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) has helped agencies address federal recruitment and retention needs. GAO analyzed CHCO agency data on use of the authorities, reviewed OPM guidance and procedures, and interviewed CHCO Council officials. What GAO Found Chief Human Capital Officers (CHCO) Council agencies used a range of special payment authorities to recruit and retain employees. GAO's analysis of CHCO agency data found that for six selected authorities, 20 or more agencies used each between fiscal years 2014-2016. Seven agencies reported using the critical position pay authority\u2014the authority reportedly used by the highest number of CHCO agencies\u2014for fewer than 100 employees per year. Moreover, many agencies reported using most of these authorities for a limited number of employees each year. For example, of the 24 agencies that reported using superior qualifications and special needs pay setting\u2014the authority reportedly used by the highest number of CHCO agencies\u2014over half (13 agencies) reported using the authority for fewer than 100 employees per year. In addition, of the 23 agencies that reported using recruitment incentives in fiscal years 2014-2016, 11 agencies reported using the authority for 10 or fewer employees per year. OPM officials said that until recently agency spending on 3R incentives had been frozen, and many agencies had to limit their use of these incentives. CHCO agencies generally reported that special payment authorities positively affected areas of operation, such as staff retention, ability to meet staffing needs, or ability to fill mission-critical positions.

    "gao_GAO-19-54": "Why GAO Did This Study DOD has obligated approximately $133 billion in fiscal year 2017 through contracts and orders. Section 813 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2017 required DOD to revise the DFARS to require that the LPTA process be used in situations where there would not be any value on a product or service exceeding the required technical or performance requirements. Section 813 also requires DOD to revise the DFARS to require that the LPTA process only be used in situations when the following eight criteria are met. GAO was asked to review DOD's use of the LPTA process. This report examines (1) the extent to which DOD used the LPTA process for fiscal year 2017 contracts and orders and (2) the extent to which DOD considered the Section 813 criteria when awarding the 14 contracts and orders GAO reviewed. GAO reviewed DOD regulations and guidance, analyzed a generalizable sample of 14 contracts and orders, and interviewed DOD contracting officials. What GAO Found Based upon the results of GAO's generalizable sample of fiscal year 2017 contracts and orders, GAO estimates that about 26 percent of DOD contracts and orders competitively awarded by the Army, Navy, Air Force, and Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) valued at $5 million and above used the LPTA process. Contracting officials associated with the 14 contracts and orders GAO reviewed used the LPTA process, in part, because they determined there was no tradeoff available or determined that DOD would not derive any benefit from paying a premium for offers that exceeded the minimum capabilities. DOD's March 2016 Source Selection Procedures states that the LPTA process may be used when there would not be additional value to a product or service exceeding the required technical or performance requirements. Therefore, these determinations are consistent with the DOD's current guidance. Contracting officials stated that they generally considered five of the eight criteria in Section 813 when awarding the 14 contracts and orders GAO reviewed. This was done, in part, because according to contracting officials, those criteria are inherently considered by contracting officials when determining which source selection process should be used. Further, based on GAO's analysis, these five criteria are generally reflected in DOD's March 2016 Source Selection Procedures. DOD has not yet revised the DFARS to include the",

The SPR is a large repository of oil and refined products, and the SPR holds about 750 million barrels of oil. The SPR is also a part of the 29 member countries' energy product reserves, which are intended to address regional supply shortages. GAO was asked to testify on the SPR's use in response to domestic supply disruptions. This statement is based on ongoing work and preliminary observations from GAO's ongoing work on the SPR. GAO reviewed relevant laws, regulations, and DOE documents and interviewed DOE officials. What GAO Found The Department of Energy (DOE) has used the Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR) to address domestic petroleum supply disruptions, but the SPR is limited in its ability to respond to domestic supply disruptions. The SPR is almost entirely composed of oil and not refined products, which may not be effective in responding to all disruptions that affect the refining sector. Second, as GAO reported in September 2014, reserves are nearly entirely located in one region, the Gulf Coast, which may limit responsiveness to disruptions in other regions.

This statement discusses (1) actions DOD has taken to address elevated levels of PFOS and PFOA in drinking water and concerns with firefighting foam, and (2) steps DOD has taken to address health and environmental concerns with its use of firefighting foam that contains PFAS. This statement is based on GAO's October 2017 report on DOD's response to PFOS and PFOA contamination in drinking water and a March 2018 report to Congress on DOD's response to PFOS and PFOA contamination. GAO reviewed DOD's response to PFOS and PFOA contamination in drinking water and DOD's response to orders from regulators. GAO also reviewed DOD's military specification for firefighting foam and interviewed DOD officials. What GAO Found The Department of Defense (DOD) has initiated actions to address elevated levels of PFOS and PFOA in drinking water and concerns with firefighting foam. DOD has identified 393 active or closed military installations with any known or suspected releases of PFOS or PFOA.

PHMSA's inspection and enforcement division is responsible for ensuring pipeline safety. PHMSA also has a partnership with interstate agents, which are state pipeline safety agencies that inspect pipelines in their jurisdictions. PHMSA may permit states to participate in interstate pipeline inspections through three types of agreements. PHMSA's Pipeline Safety and Infrastructure Protection Act of 2016 included a provision for GAO to review PHMSA's partnership with interstate agents. This report examines (1) the extent to which state involvement in interstate pipeline inspections can enhance pipeline safety, and (2) how PHMSA allocates its inspection resources. GAO reviewed PHMSA documents and interviewed PHMSA officials in five states with pipeline safety programs and six states that have applied for interstate agent agreements. GAO also interviewed PHMSA officials in four states that have applied for interstate agent agreements. What GAO Found The Pipeline Safety and Infrastructure Protection Act of 2016 (PIPES Act) included a provision for GAO to review the Pipeline Safety and Infrastructure Protection Act of 2016 (the Pipeline Safety and Infrastructure Protection Act). This report examines the extent to which state involvement in interstate pipeline inspections can enhance pipeline safety. According to PHMSA regional officials GAO met with, interstate agents conduct high-quality inspections of interstate pipelines and provide an important supplement to the federal inspection workforce. PHMSA officials generally agreed that interstate agents have well-trained staff and leverage their local knowledge to enhance interstate pipeline inspections within their state. Additionally, interstate agents, if authorized by PHMSA, may conduct inspections of interstate pipelines within their state more frequently than PHMSA. For instance, in one region, PHMSA officials said that if interstate agent agreements were discontinued, the region would need to hire 3 to 4 additional inspectors. In another region, officials said that interstate agents provided the equivalent of 5 to 10 additional inspectors.

This report examines the extent to which the Bank has (1) adopted the Fraud Risk Framework and (2) established an organizational culture and structure conducive to fraud risk management. GAO surveyed Bank employees, reviewed relevant documents, and interviewed Bank managers and staff. What GAO Found The Export-Import Bank of the United States (the Bank) has identified a dedicated entity to lead fraud risk management activities, as called for in GAO's Fraud Risk Framework. In addition, employees generally have a positive view of antifraud efforts across the Bank, according to GAO's employee survey. However, GAO also found that management and staff have differing views on key aspects of the Bank's antifraud culture. For example, the Bank has not established a clear antifraud tone, as called for by the Fraud Risk Framework, and the Bank's approach for preventing, detecting, and addressing fraud is not consistent with leading practices of the Fraud Risk Framework. Bank managers said that GAO's findings provide an opportunity for additional staff training on fraud issues. The Bank has taken some steps to assess fraud risk, but it has not conducted a fraud risk assessment, tailored to its operations, or created a fraud risk profile, both as provided in the Fraud Risk Framework. The Bank has been compiling a \"risk register\" intended to catalog risks it faces across the organization, but this compilation does not include some known fraud risks, indicating that the Bank's assessment is incomplete. In addition, GAO found that while the Bank has adopted a general position on the degree of risk it will tolerate, its current risk tolerance is not specific and measurable, as provided by federal internal control standards. Bank managers told GAO they will revise their fraud risk management practices to fully adopt the Fraud Risk Framework.

GAO has reported on SSA's disability programs since 1990, and has identified a number of challenges that SSA faces in managing its programs and ensuring program integrity. This statement discusses (1) challenges SSA faces in managing its disability programs and ensuring program integrity, and (2) challenges SSA faces in modernizing its physical footprint and service delivery. This statement is based on GAO's body of work issued from January 2010 through February 2017, and selected updates conducted in February 2017 on SSA's progress in addressing GAO's prior recommendations. What GAO Found Complex eligibility rules and multiple handoffs and potential layers of review make SSA's disability programs complicated and costly to administer. Program complexity arguably has made it challenging for SSA to make significant advances in efficiently managing high disability workloads, ensuring timely and consistent disability decisions, preventing benefit overpayments, and mitigating fraud risks. GAO's recent work highlighted some of the challenges SSA faces in making disability decisions that are timely, consistent and based on current concepts of disability, while also preventing and deterring fraud and ensuring that only beneficiaries who are entitled to benefits receive them.

GAO was asked to review the Navy's and Marine Corps' efforts to improve naval integration for amphibious operations. This report examines the extent to which (1) the Navy and Marine Corps have completed training for amphibious operations priorities and taken steps to mitigate any training shortfalls, (2) the Navy's and Marine Corps' efforts to improve naval integration for amphibious operations incorporate leading collaborative practices, and (3) the Marine Corps has integrated selected virtual training devices into its operational training. GAO reviewed Navy and Marine Corps documents and interviewed officials from the services' headquarters, components, and operating forces. What GAO Found The Navy and Marine Corps units that are deploying as part of an Amphibious Ready Group (ARG) completed their required training for amphibious operations, but several factors have limited the ability of Marine Corps units to conduct training for other amphibious operations-related priorities. For example, the Navy's fleet of amphibious ships has declined by half in the last 25 years, from 62 in 1990 to 31 today, with current shipbuilding plans calling for four additional amphibious ships to be added by fiscal year 2024, increasing the total number of amphibious ships to 35. The Navy and Marine Corps have taken steps to identify and address training shortfalls, but their efforts to mitigate these shortfalls have not prioritized available training resources, systematically evaluated among potential training resource alternatives to accomplish the services' amphibious operations training priorities, or monitored progress toward achieving them. Without such an approach, the services are not well positioned to mitigate existing amphibious operations training shortfalls and begin to rebuild their amphibious capability as the services await the arrival of additional amphibious ships into the fleet. The Navy and Marine Corps have taken some steps to improve coordination between the two services, but the services have not fully incorporated leading collaboration practices that would help drive efforts to improve naval integration for amphibious operations. GAO's prior work on interagency collaboration has found that certain practices can help enhance and sustain collaboration among federal agencies.

GAO analyzed federal cost report data for 2015, reviewed literature, and interviewed federal and state officials and experts. What GAO Found Federal agencies and state Medicaid agencies spent over $16.3 billion on graduate medical education (GME) training in 2015, and the amount spent per full-time-equivalent (FTE) resident varied across programs, and the largest variation across payment recipients and regions was within Medicare due to variation in the values of factors used to calculate Medicare payment amounts. The amount spent per FTE resident varied across programs, and the largest variation across payment recipients and regions was within Medicare due to variation in the values of factors used to calculate Medicare payment amounts. Almost half of participants received payments from more than one program, and the designs of federal programs may reduce the potential for duplicate payments. GME training costs vary by program characteristics, such as size, type, training setting, and age, and some training costs are more prone to variation than others. Challenges exist in measuring and comparing GME training costs due to a lack of standard cost methodologies across teaching sites and some training costs being difficult to measure. Little is known about how GME training costs relate to federal GME funding. Agencies generally collect information to manage their respective programs, ensure the accuracy of payments, and reduce the potential for duplicative payments within or across federal programs that fund GME training. However, HHS does not have sufficient information available to comprehensively evaluate the federal programs that fund GME training, identify gaps between federal GME programs' results and physician workforce needs, and make or recommend to Congress changes in order to improve the efficient and effective use of federal funds.

What GAO Found The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services' (CMS) payment error rate measurement for Medicaid managed care measures the accuracy of the capitated payments state Medicaid agencies make to managed care organizations (MCO) on behalf of enrollees. However, the PERM does not account for other program integrity risks\u2014such as overpayments to providers and unallowable MCO costs. For example, the PERM does not account for errors in capitated payments made to MCOs, which are payments made to MCOs for services that were not provided or medically necessary. In addition, CMS regulations state that overpayments in managed care include any payment made to an MCO or provider under contract to an MCO to which the MCO or provider is not entitled under Medicaid. As a result, the PERM improper payment estimate potentially understates the extent of program integrity risks in Medicaid managed care. Moreover, this potential understatement in the PERM's improper payment rate estimate may curtail investigations into the appropriateness of MCO spending. CMS has increased its focus on and worked with states to improve oversight of Medicaid managed care; however, these efforts and the oversight efforts of states do not ensure the identification and reporting of overpayments and unallowable costs. In recent years, CMS has sought to strengthen oversight of managed care programs through updated regulations; reviews of states' managed care programs (Focused Program Integrity Reviews); and state monitoring of overpayments. CMS has also expanded collaborative audits of MCOs and providers under contract to MCOs. However, these efforts fall short of mitigating the limitations of the PERM estimates of improper payments for",
    "gao_GAO-18-539": "Why GAO Did This Study The U.S. public transportation system is increasingly influenced by the \"sharing economy,\" which is based on sharing, renting, and borrowing goods and services, rather than owning them. The Federal Transit Administration's (FTA) MOD program is a key effort to help local transit agencies explore emerging shared mobility technologies, in part by partnering with private mobility companies. GAO was asked to review partnerships. This report examines (1) the extent to which selected local transit agencies have partnered with private mobility companies to provide on-demand services, and (2) the potential impact of selected local transit agencies' partnerships on the future. GAO reviewed relevant federal laws, regulations, and FTA documents; analyzed FTA data on ridership and costs; and interviewed FTA officials and selected local transit agencies. What GAO Found Local transit agencies nationwide are pursuing partnerships to offer a variety of on-demand services that aim to make access to public transportation more efficient and convenient. The private mobility companies involved in selected partnerships include some well-known companies such as Uber and Lyft, and some lesser-known types of companies such as a bike-share company and technology companies focused on transportation. Selected local transit agencies most frequently partnered with ridesourcing companies (11 projects), while 8 partnership projects included more than one type of private partner. Five of the 22 partnership projects were in FTA's MOD Sandbox program. Most of the selected projects (14 of 22) involved on-demand first- and last-mile transportation connections, through which respective local transit agencies aim to increase ridership on their transit systems. Most of the selected projects (14 of 22) involved on-demand services targeted toward paratransit-eligible riders, either as the primary project goal or to ensure equivalent service for eligible customers. Most of the selected projects have not yet been evaluated to determine whether they achieved intended outcomes. However, a few transit officials told GAO that their agencies' costs had decreased since initiating the partnerships. For example, an official from one transit agency reported that the on-demand service provided through their partnership had helped them reduce costs for paratransit. Two of the completed partnerships generated insufficient ridership to succeed. The partnerships were widely covered by the press, which transit agency officials believe provides other transit agencies the opportunity to learn from them as well. FTA's MOD program is a key effort under way to encourage and better understand transit partnerships. Since first",
    "gao_GAO-19-144": "Why GAO Did This Study The federal government and private industry face a persistent shortage of cybersecurity and IT professionals to implement and oversee information security protections to combat cyber threats. The Federal Cybersecurity Workforce Assessment Act of 2015 required OPM, NIST, and other federal agencies to undertake a number of cybersecurity workforce-planning activities. The act also required OPM to provide agencies with timely guidance for identifying IT, cybersecurity, and cyber-related work roles of critical need. GAO was asked to review federal agencies' implementation of the act's selected activities. This report (1) determines the extent to which federal agencies have assigned work role codes to positions performing information technology (IT), cybersecurity, or cyber-related functions, and (2) describes the steps federal agencies took to identify work roles of critical need. GAO reviewed the act's provisions and OPM's guidance and interviewed agency officials. What GAO Found The 24 major departments and agencies covered by the Chief Financial Officers (CFO) Act of 1990 had generally assigned work role codes to their positions performing information technology (IT), cybersecurity, or cyber-related functions. However, several agencies had not completed assigning codes to their vacant positions. In addition, most agencies had likely miscategorized the work roles of many positions. For example, the 24 agencies routinely assigned work role codes to positions that were likely inconsistent with the positions' functions. For example, the 24 agencies assigned a code designated for positions that did not perform IT, cybersecurity, or cyber-related functions to positions that most likely performed these functions. The act required OPM to identify critical needs across federal agencies and submit a progress report to Congress on the identification of IT, cybersecurity, or cyber-related work roles of critical need by December 2017. OPM also required agencies to submit a preliminary report on work roles of critical need by August 31, 2018. The 24 agencies have begun to identify critical needs and submit preliminary reports to OPM. As of November 2018, OPM and the 24 agencies had taken steps to address the three selected activities required by the act. Specifically, OPM had reported on agencies' progress in identifying critical needs and had provided agencies with guidance for identifying IT, cybersecurity, and cyber-related work roles of critical need. In addition, the 24 agencies had submitted preliminary reports of their identified critical needs to OPM, but their efforts to identify critical needs were ongoing.",
    "gao_GAO-18-417": "Why GAO Did This Study The defense laboratories are responsible for a wide range of research, development, and engineering activities, including the development of nuclear weapons, nuclear materials, and other materials. The National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2017 included a provision for GAO to review the defense laboratories' hiring efforts. This report examines (1) the defense laboratories' use of existing hiring authorities and what officials view as the benefits of authorities and incentives and the challenges in hiring; (2) the extent to which the Department of Defense (DOD) evaluates the effectiveness of hiring, including hiring authorities, at the defense laboratories; and (3) the extent to which DOD has time frames for approving and implementing new hiring authorities. GAO analyzed DOD hiring data for fiscal years 2015 through 2017, and interviewed DOD, military service, and defense laboratory officials. What GAO Found The defense laboratories have used the defense laboratory-specific direct hire authorities more than any other category of agency-specific or government-wide hiring authority. For example, the direct hire authorities for candidates with advanced degrees were used for 55 percent of all direct hires, and the direct hire authorities for candidates with bachelor's degrees were used for approximately 36 percent of all direct hires. The defense laboratories' use of these hiring authorities increased each year from fiscal year 2015 through fiscal year 2017. For fiscal years 2015 through 2017, the defense laboratories used the defense laboratory-specific direct hire authorities more often than any other category of hiring authorities when hiring STEM personnel. Moreover, the defense laboratories' use of these hiring authorities increased each year from fiscal year 2015 through fiscal year 2017. For fiscal year 2017, the defense laboratories used the defense laboratory direct hire authorities for 54 percent of STEM hiring actions completed, representing an increase of approximately 16 percentage points relative to fiscal year 2015, when 38 percent were hired under defense lab direct hire authorities. However, even with access to the authorities, these defense laboratory officials identified challenges associated with the hiring process that affected their ability to hire highly qualified candidates. For example, the defense laboratories' flexibility in pay setting under their demonstration project authority was generally considered to be the most helpful incentive, with 13 of 16 survey respondents stating that this incentive had very much helped them to hire highly qualified candidates. However, even with access to the authorities, these defense laboratory officials identified challenges associated with the hiring process that affected their ability to hire highly qualified candidates. For example, the defense laboratories have lost quality candidates to the private sector, and the department-wide hiring freeze has delayed hiring",

The W78 is the only U.S. nuclear warhead that can be used in a nuclear explosive package. NNSA is responsible for developing and acquiring new nuclear components, such as lithium, for the W78. NNSA's W78 replacement program is intended to replace the W78 warhead in U.S. nuclear weapons. The program is currently suspended because of a lack of funding and other factors. GAO was asked to review the W78 replacement program. This report examines (1) steps NNSA has taken to prepare to restart a W78 replacement program and (2) the extent to which NNSA has identified the facilities and capabilities needed to provide the nuclear and nonnuclear components for a W78 replacement. GAO reviewed NNSA documents and interviewed NNSA officials. What GAO Found The National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA) has taken steps to prepare to restart a program to replace the W78 nuclear warhead capability. NNSA has (1) taken initial steps to establish the program management functions needed to execute the program and assemble personnel for a program management team; (2) assessed technologies that have been under development while the program was suspended that could potentially be used to support a W78 replacement; and (3) initiated plans for the facilities and capabilities needed to provide the nuclear and nonnuclear components for the warhead. NNSA and the Department of Defense (DOD) officials stated that, in response to the 2018 Nuclear Posture Review, they planned to restart a program that would focus on replacing the capabilities of the W78 for the Air Force; however, the extent to which the program would focus on providing a nuclear explosive package for the Navy was uncertain. DOD officials said that the Navy plans to complete a study examining the feasibility of using the nuclear explosive package developed for the W78 replacement warhead in its SLBM system by the end of fiscal year 2019. According to DOD officials, the Nuclear Weapons Council will make a decision about developing an interoperable warhead for the Air Force and the Navy based on the results of the study but, as of August 2018, had not established time frames for making that decision. According to Air Force and NNSA officials, if the Nuclear Weapons Council decided that the Navy should participate in the program, then NNSA would not need to redo the work",
    "gao_GAO-18-290": "Why GAO Did This Study The federal government invests billions of dollars annually in STEM education programs to enhance the nation's economic and educational competitiveness. The National Science and Technology Council's Committee on STEM Education and the Office of Science and Technology Policy have responsibilities for coordinating federal STEM education efforts. GAO was asked to review the extent to which federal STEM education programs have been funded in fiscal year 2016. This report examines (1) the extent to which federal STEM education programs have been funded in fiscal year 2016, and (2) the extent to which the Committee has assessed the effectiveness of the portfolio of STEM education programs. GAO analyzed agency data on the number of STEM education programs and spending in fiscal year 2016, and interviewed agency officials. What GAO Found Program officials from the 13 federal agencies that administer STEM education programs reported a total of 163 STEM education programs in fiscal year 2016, compared to 209 programs in fiscal year 2010. Three agencies\u2014the Department of Energy, the Department of Health and Human Services, and the National Science Foundation\u2014administered more than half of all STEM education programs in fiscal years 2010 and 2016. Despite collectively reporting fewer STEM education programs, program officials responding to GAO's questionnaire reported spending about the same amount in fiscal year 2016 as they did in fiscal year 2010. In fiscal year 2016, program officials reported spending about $2.9 billion on the 163 programs. The National Science Foundation and the Department of Health and Human Services programs account for about 60 percent of this spending. Many of the 163 STEM education programs in fiscal year 2016 overlapped with at least one other STEM education program, in that they offered similar services to similar groups in similar STEM fields to achieve similar objectives. Similarities occurred among programs funded in fiscal year 2010. Many of the 163 programs had similar objectives, such as providing training opportunities for undergraduate or graduate students in STEM fields. However, some programs served distinct populations within those broader groups, such as minority, disadvantaged, or underrepresented groups. The Committee on STEM Education and the Office of Science and Technology Policy have not fully met their responsibilities to assess the STEM education portfolio. Specifically, the Committee has not reviewed performance assessments of STEM education programs to ensure effectiveness\u2014a primary function of its authorizing charter. The Committee has not documented the outcomes of programs' performance assessments in its federal STEM education inventory. By periodically documenting in its federal STEM education inventory whether programs have been assessed for effectiveness, the Committee could enhance communication of performance information among agency officials and stakeholders.",
    "gao_GAO-19-57": "Why GAO Did This Study Federal agencies hold billions of dollars in real property assets, including roads, bridges, and buildings. GAO was asked to review federal agencies' efforts to manage their real property assets. This report examines (1) key characteristics of an effective asset management framework, and how selected federal agencies' frameworks reflect these characteristics; (2) views of selected asset management experts and practitioners on challenges and benefits to implementing an asset management framework; and (3) whether government-wide asset management guidance and information reflect standards and key characteristics of an effective asset management framework. GAO reviewed relevant literature, analyzed fiscal year 2017 Federal Real Property Profile data, and interviewed officials from six federal agencies selected based on their size, mission, and experience in managing their assets. GAO also interviewed representatives from private industry, federal agencies, and local municipalities in Canada, which have developed and implemented asset management practices. What GAO Found Based on GAO's review of asset management literature, asset management literature, and interviews with experts, GAO identified six key characteristics of an effective asset management framework: (1) establishing formal policies and plans, (2) maximizing an asset portfolio's value, (3) maintaining leadership support, (4) using quality data, (5) promoting a collaborative organizational culture, and (6) evaluating and improving asset management practices. Each of the six agencies GAO reviewed had a real property asset management framework that included some of these key characteristics. However, agencies varied in how they performed activities in these areas. For example, while some agencies' asset management policies applied to large portions of their portfolios, other agencies' policies applied to only certain portions of their portfolios. In addition, two agencies\u2014the Corps and Coast Guard\u2014told GAO they were using the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) 55000 standards. For example, according to Corps officials, the Corps is in the process of incorporating elements of the ISO 55000 standards into its frameworks. Coast Guard officials told GAO they were using the ISO 55000 standards as a benchmark to compare against their existing framework. According to GAO's review of asset management literature, establishing formal policies and plans can help agencies take a more strategic approach in their asset management decision making and identify key roles and responsibilities, resources required to implement their plans, potential implementation obstacles and strategies for overcoming these obstacles. In addition, each of the six agencies GAO reviewed had developed a formal asset management plan in response to Executive Order 133",
    "gao_GAO-18-606": "Why GAO Did This Study Substance use is a leading cause of death in the United States, and the federal government provides grants to help address this problem. In fiscal year 2017, the federal government provided about $1.2 billion in grants to states, territories, and one federally recognized tribe. GAO was asked to review federal grant programs that address substance use prevention, treatment, and recovery services among adolescents and young adults. This report examines (1) the extent to which federal grant programs have targeted adolescents and young adults' use of illicit substances and (2) the extent to which HHS's NIDA has funded research projects that address these issues. GAO reviewed relevant federal laws, regulations, and agency documents; analyzed HHS data on grantees' use of these funds; and interviewed agency officials and stakeholders, including researchers, advocacy organizations, and others. What GAO Found GAO identified 12 federal grant programs within three of the four agencies in its review that funded substance use prevention, treatment, and recovery services in fiscal year 2017 and targeted adolescents' and young adults' use of illicit substances. Eight of these programs focused on prevention, and all 8 remain active in fiscal year 2018. The 12 programs had ongoing or planned evaluations to assess the effectiveness of their grantees in accomplishing a variety of program goals, according to agency officials. Four of the 12 programs targeted substance use treatment and recovery services and had active grantees in fiscal year 2017. Two of the 4 programs ended at the close of fiscal year 2017 and the other 2 remained active in fiscal year 2018. The 4 programs had different purposes and were administered by the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) or the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). For example, SAMHSA's Cooperative Agreements for Adolescent and Transitional Aged Youth Treatment Implementation had the largest number of active grantees (36), which included state substance abuse agencies and federally recognized tribes. The three juvenile drug treatment court programs had a total of 21 active grantees, which included state substance abuse agencies and federally recognized tribes. Most of the 186 active grant-funded research projects for adolescents and young adults in fiscal year 2017 focused on substance use prevention. Specifically, 126 research projects, or about 68 percent of the projects, involved research related to preventing the use of illicit substances, such as the use of marijuana or nonmedical use of opioids and",
    "gao_GAO-18-348": "Why GAO Did This Study DOD established the Exceptional Family Member Programs (EFMP) in 2010 to help military families with special needs identify and gain access to programs and services at their current, as well as proposed, locations. The NDAA for Fiscal Year 2017 included a provision for GAO to assess the effectiveness of the EFMP. This report examines (1) the extent to which each Service has provided family support as required by DOD, and (2) the extent to which the Services monitor and DOD evaluates assignment coordination and family support. GAO reviewed relevant federal laws, regulations, and DOD guidance and documentation; analyzed fiscal year 2016 EFMP data; and interviewed DOD, Service, and nonfederal officials. What GAO Found Key aspects of support for families with special needs vary widely across the Department of Defense's (DOD) four Services, leading to potential gaps in assistance for families with special needs. DOD officials said each Service provides family support services in accordance with DOD guidance as well as Service-specific guidance. However, GAO found wide variation in each Service's requirements for family support personnel as well as the practices and expectations of EFMP staff. As a result the type, amount, and frequency of assistance enrolled families receive varies from Service to Service and when a servicemember from one Service is assigned to a joint base led by another Service. For example, in terms of a minimum level of contact for families with special needs enrolled in the EFMP, the Services vary in the frequency with which they require family support providers to contact families with special needs. The Services also vary as to whether they offer legal assistance to families with special needs. DOD has specifically required each Service to develop and maintain a services plan (SP) for each family with special needs, and DOD has specifically required these plans as part of the provision of family support services. However, DOD has not developed a standard for determining the sufficiency of funding and resources each Service allocates for family support. Without fully identifying and addressing potential gaps in family support across these programs, some families with special needs may not get the assistance they require, particularly when they relocate. Each Service has mechanisms to monitor assignment coordination and family support activities, but DOD lacks common performance measures and a process to fully evaluate these activities. DOD requires each Service to monitor implementation of their EFMP, including procedures for assignment",

The fiscal year 2017 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) included a provision for GAO to conduct biennial audits of such programs. This report examines (1) the status of funding that DOD allocated for Global Train and Equip projects in 2009 through 2017, (2) the extent to which DOD addressed security assistance planning elements in project proposals in 2016 and 2017, and (3) DOD's reporting on the achievement of Global Train and Equip project objectives and any factors affecting its ability to achieve those objectives. GAO analyzed DOD funding data, program guidelines, project proposal documents, and congressional notifications; reviewed DOD's assessment reports and supporting documents; and interviewed DOD officials. What GAO Found Of the $4.1 billion allocated for Global Train and Equip projects in 2009 through 2017, the Department of Defense (DOD) has obligated approximately $3.7 billion and disbursed $2.5 billion. DOD allocated the funds for Global Train and Equip projects in 2009 through 2017, according to the fiscal year in which DOD allocated the funds. DOD allocated the funds for Global Train and Equip projects in Jordan and Lebanon, which received a combined total of $856 million, or 47 percent of total allocations during that period. DOD's 2016 and 2017 proposals for Global Train and Equip projects consistently addressed only one of the four planning elements called for by DOD guidance, but agency officials reported implementing an informal process to improve coverage of these planning elements in 2018 proposals. DOD's 2016 and 2017 guidance called for proposal packages to address (1) project objectives, (2) partner nation absorptive capacity, (3) baseline assessments of partner nation capabilities, and (4) project sustainment needs. All 72 proposal packages GAO reviewed for 2016 and 2017 included project objectives. Slightly more than 30 percent of proposal packages in 2016 and over 80 percent in 2017 included information about partner nations' absorptive capacity, compared with 19 percent in 2015. However, less than three-quarters of proposal packages in 2016 and 2017 included complete sustainment plans, with the percentage that did so declining from 73 percent in 2016 to 68 percent in 2017. DOD's 2016 and 2017 guidance called for proposals to address sustainment planning, but it did not provide instructions for doing so",

The Judgment Fund is also available to pay interest and costs on claims in certain circumstances. In connection with its oversight efforts, the House Committee on the Judiciary (Committee) requested certain information from Treasury about Judgment Fund balances, activities, and other information. GAO was asked to (1) evaluate the extent to which the information Treasury provided to the Committee responds to the Committee's May 2017 request for information about Judgment Fund balances and activities and reconciles to financial information included in annual, audited financial reports and other selected reports and (2) describe the Bureau of the Fiscal Service's documented procedures and related control activities for processing agency requests for payments from the Judgment Fund, including how Fiscal Service ensures that appropriate agency official approve claims and what reviews are required, if any, to ensure receipt of required documentation. GAO reviewed Treasury's documentation and interviewed agency officials. What GAO Found In response to the Committee's May 2017 request for information about Judgment Fund balances and activities, Treasury provided to the Committee nine exhibits that contained selected information on Judgment Fund payments and other related information to answer nine questions in the Committee's request. GAO reviewed the Treasury-provided information and found that it did not provide the Schedules of Judgment Fund Non-Entity Assets, Non-Entity Costs, and Custodial Revenues for fiscal years 2010 through 2016, prepared in accordance with U.S. Government Accountability Office (GAAP) and appropriate note disclosures or MD&A to the Committee, as requested. In addition, GAO identified numerous differences between amounts included in the exhibits provided to the Committee and those reported in Treasury's (1) unaudited transparency reports, (2) audited Schedules, or (3) audited Financial Statements. For example, GAO identified differences between administrative and litigative payments for fiscal years 2010 through 2016 reported on Exhibits 1 and 2--Judicial and Litigative Payments by Defendant Agency and Fiscal Year and those reported in Treasury'",

VA's Patient Advocacy Program is intended to provide veterans with a means to provide feedback about health care services they receive at VAMCs. GAO was asked to review the patient advocacy program. This report examines (1) the extent to which VHA has provided guidance to VAMCs on the program's governance, (2) the extent to which VHA has recommended training for patient advocates, and (3) the extent to which VHA has monitored patient advocacy data-entry practices and reviewed patient advocacy data to assess program performance and identify system-wide improvements. GAO reviewed VHA's patient advocacy program handbook, reviewed program data, and interviewed VA officials. What GAO Found The Veterans Health Administration (VHA) has provided limited guidance to Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) medical centers (VAMC) on the governance of the patient advocacy program. Specifically, VHA provided limited guidance on how to meet the program's expectations that veterans have easy access to a patient advocate who will hear their complaints and address them in a timely manner. While VHA's handbook for the program provides general information on the responsibilities of patient advocacy program staff, it does not specify the VAMC department to which patient advocates should report to help ensure VAMCs meet these expectations. According to VHA officials, the lack of specific guidance was intentional and due in part to VHA officials' view that leadership at each VAMC is in the best position to understand the needs of veterans at their facilities, and therefore should have flexibility to make decisions about governance in response to those needs. In addition, VHA's patient advocacy program handbook is out of date and does not incorporate recent agency-wide changes, such as those made in response to VHA Strategic Plan FY 2013 \u2013 2018. Without providing specific, timely guidance to VAMCs on the governance of the program, the program is at risk of not meeting its minimum expectations.

FEMA and USACE have established advance contracts to help FEMA rapidly mobilize resources in response to disasters. GAO was asked to review FEMA's use of these contracts. This report addresses the extent to which (1) FEMA and USACE used advance contracts, (2) FEMA and USACE planned, managed, and reported selected FEMA and USACE advance contracts met selected contracting requirements, and (3) FEMA and USACE identified any lessons learned and challenges with their use of these contracts. GAO reviewed relevant federal laws, regulations, and guidance; analyzed FEMA and USACE contracting data; and interviewed FEMA and USACE officials. What GAO Found The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) used advance contracts to respond to the 2017 hurricanes and California wildfires, but FEMA's and USACE's use of advance contracts resulted in confusion about whether and how to prioritize and use advance contracts to quickly mobilize resources in response to the three 2017 hurricanes and California wildfires. FEMA and USACE obligated 46 percent, or about $3.8 billion, of the $8.2 billion spent government-wide on the three hurricanes and wildfires through advance contracts. FEMA and USACE obligated 86 percent, or about $667 million, of the contract obligations they identified for the California wildfires.

GAO was asked to review the Forest Service's budget execution processes. This report assesses the extent to which the Forest Service properly designed control activities over (1) allotments of budgetary resources, its system for administrative control of funds, and any fund transfers between Forest Service appropriations; (2) reimbursables and related collections; and (3) unliquidated obligations. GAO reviewed Forest Service documents and control activities, reviewed relevant guidance, and interviewed agency officials. What GAO Found The Forest Service did not have an adequate process and related control activities for reasonably assuring that (1) amounts designated in appropriations acts for specific purposes are used as designated and (2) unobligated no-year appropriation balances from prior years were reviewed for their continuing need. GAO reviewed Forest Service documents related to its budget authority processes, which included control objectives, related control activities, and processes over the allotment of its budgetary resources. GAO found that these documents did not include an adequate process and related control activities for assuring that appropriated amounts are used for the purposes designated. For example, such a process would include the Forest Service allotting appropriated funds for specific programs or objects as provided in the applicable appropriations act, by either using specific budget line items already defined in the Forest Service's financial system or creating new budget line items, as needed. Standards for Internal Control in the Federal Government states that management should define objectives clearly to enable the identification of risks and design appropriate control activities to achieve objectives and respond to the risks identified.

PAMA also requires GAO to report on the potential effects of PAMA's provisions and CMS's actions on Medicare payments. This report examines (1) the characteristics of laboratories that receive Medicare payment under PAMA and (2) the extent to which CMS has collected and reported private-payer data on private-payer rates. GAO reviewed relevant laws, regulations, and guidance; analyzed private-payer data CMS collected from about 2,000 laboratories; and interviewed agency officials and laboratory industry representatives. What GAO Found Private-payer rates for laboratory tests generally vary by laboratory type and other characteristics, according to market reports and the laboratory industry officials GAO interviewed. The three largest laboratory types that received the most revenue from the Clinical Laboratory Fee Schedule (CLFS) in 2016 were independent laboratories, hospital-outreach laboratories, and physician-office laboratories. CMS analyzed private-payer data it collected from about 2,000 laboratories to develop new payment rates for individual laboratory tests. CMS used these data to calculate a median, private-payer rate, weighted by volume and phased in this change by limiting payment-rate reductions to 10 percent per year. CMS collected private-payer data from about 2,000 laboratories to develop new payment rates for individual laboratory tests. CMS did not collect private-payer data from all laboratories required to report this information and did not estimate how much data was missing because not all laboratories reported or the extent to which the data collected were representative of all of the data that laboratories were required to report.

    "gao_GAO-18-61": "Why GAO Did This Study Sunscreen is one of the most common methods of protecting against UVA rays. FDA regulates OTC drugs, including sunscreens, as nonprescription drugs, which are drugs considered to be safe for use by consumers without the intervention of a health care professional. FDA has received applications for eight sunscreen active ingredients since 2002, and FDA has requested additional safety and effectiveness data to determine if these ingredients are GRASE. SIA included requirements related to FDA's review of non-sunscreen TEAs. GAO was asked to review FDA's review of sunscreen active ingredients. This report examines (1) FDA's implementation of SIA requirements for reviewing applications for sunscreen active ingredients, and (2) steps FDA has taken to review applications for non-sunscreen active ingredients. GAO reviewed FDA regulations and guidance, and interviewed FDA officials and representatives of the sponsors associated with the six non-sunscreen TEAs submitted prior to SIA's enactment. GAO also interviewed FDA officials and representatives of the sponsors associated with the six non-sunscreen TEAs submitted prior to SIA's enactment. What GAO Found The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) implemented requirements for reviewing applications for sunscreen active ingredients within the time frames required by the Sunscreen Innovation Act (SIA) in 2014. FDA issued final guidance for applications for sunscreen active ingredients in November 2016, and issued two additional reports to Congress in 2018 and 2020. FDA also implemented changes to the process for reviewing sunscreen applications as required by SIA. FDA completed its review of the safety and effectiveness data for each of the eight sunscreen active ingredient applications that it received prior to SIA's enactment in 2014. FDA's review concluded that the eight sunscreen active ingredients were not GRASE because the data were insufficient to make a determination, and that additional data are needed to determine otherwise. FDA officials said that the delays in reviewing sunscreen applications can be attributed to inadequate resources to carry out the agency's OTC drug responsibilities and a lengthy multi-step rulemaking process, which the applications were subject to prior to SIA. FDA officials estimate that as of October 2017 approximately one third of the monographs are not yet final, and several hundred active ingredients, including those used in sunscreen products, do not have a final GRASE determination. Sponsors questioned FDA's request for additional safety and effectiveness data and no data have been",

FWS and NOAA are responsible for enforcing laws and treaties prohibiting wildlife trafficking. FWS and NOAA may pay financial rewards for information on wildlife trafficking. GAO was asked to review FWS and NOAA's use of financial rewards. This report (1) identifies laws that authorize FWS and NOAA to pay financial rewards for information on wildlife trafficking and the extent to which these agencies paid such rewards from fiscal years 2007 through 2017, (2) evaluates FWS's and NOAA's policies on financial rewards, (3) evaluates the information available to the public on financial rewards, and (4) determines the extent to which FWS and NOAA reviewed the effectiveness of their use of financial rewards in combating wildlife trafficking. GAO analyzed FWS and NOAA data on financial rewards paid from fiscal years 2007 through 2017, reviewed relevant FWS and NOAA policies, and interviewed FWS and NOAA officials. What GAO Found The Department of the Interior's U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) and the Department of Commerce's National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) reported paying few financial rewards for information on wildlife trafficking from fiscal years 2007 through 2017, but agency officials could not provide sufficient assurance that the reward information they provided to GAO represented all of the rewards they paid for this period. FWS and NOAA officials identified multiple laws, such as the Endangered Species Act and the Lacey Act, that authorize the payment of financial rewards to people who provide information on wildlife trafficking. FWS and NOAA officials reported paying few financial rewards for information on wildlife trafficking from fiscal years 2007 through 2017, but agency officials could not provide sufficient assurance that the reward information they provided to GAO represented all of the rewards they paid for this period. FWS officials said they generally paid rewards to thank sources who proactively provided information. NOAA officials said they paid rewards to thank the source who proactively provided information to law enforcement agents. FWS and NOAA officials said that maintaining comprehensive information on the rewards they paid could motivate agents to make greater use of rewards as a law enforcement tool. FWS and NOAA have policies outlining the processes their law enforcement agents are to use in making reward payments, and NOAA's policy specifies factors for",

RRB annually calculates the amount it would have collected in taxes from rail workers and their employers, and what SSA would have paid in benefits if rail workers had been covered under Social Security. GAO was asked to review RRB's financial interchange calculation. This report examines (1) how RRB calculates the amounts it calculates and how it has calculated the amounts, (2) how RRB oversees the process, and (3) the extent to which RRB and SSA review the results of the financial interchange calculations. GAO reviewed RRB's financial interchange calculations and RRB's annual financial interchange determination reports, and interviewed RRB, SSA, and HHS officials. What GAO Found The Railroad Retirement Board (RRB) calculates the amounts it would have collected in taxes from rail workers and their employers, and what SSA would have paid in benefits if rail workers had been covered under Social Security. RRB annually calculates the amounts that SSA would have collected in taxes from rail workers and their employers, and what SSA would have paid in benefits if rail workers had been covered under Social Security. RRB annually computes the financial interchange amount each year, which is done on a retrospective basis, i.e., the amount is determined for the previous fiscal year. RRB officials said that in light of the number of RRB cases\u2014nearly 400,000\u2014it is not practical to make these calculations annually for each case. Instead, RRB uses Social Security Administration (SSA) rules to calculate benefits for a subset of RRB cases in which the worker's Social Security number ends in 30, which approximates a 1-percent sample.

In October 2018, NNSA terminated the MOX project in favor of pursuing an alternative plutonium disposition approach. GAO was asked to review the MOX project. This report examines (1) when NNSA's project management oversight processes recognized cost and schedule problems at the MOX project and the actions the agency took to address them and (2) the extent to which DOE requires that project management lessons learned from MOX and other projects be documented and shared. GAO reviewed relevant documents and interviewed DOE, NNSA, and MOX Services, LLC (MOX Services), the contractor constructing the MOX project. What GAO Found The Department of Energy (DOE) and the National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA) have faced recurring project management problems that have affected their ability to manage contracts and projects effectively. For more than 2 decades, GAO and others have reported on the recurring nature of the problems affecting DOE's and NNSA's ability to manage contracts and projects effectively. In a March 2007 report, GAO found that 9 of 12 major projects GAO reviewed\u2014including the MOX project\u2014had exceeded their original cost estimates, schedule estimates, or both, principally because of ineffective project oversight and contractor management. In April 2015, GAO found that NNSA had a long history of identifying corrective actions for problems and declaring them successfully resolved, only to then identify additional actions needed to address the problems. As a result, the recurrence of such problems suggests that NNSA did not have a full understanding of the root causes of its contract- and project-management challenges. Moreover, GAO's 2017 high-risk report found that DOE had taken several important steps that demonstrate its commitment to improving contract and project management, but that DOE's efforts had not fully addressed several areas where the department continues to have shortcomings. Areas with shortcomings include acquisition planning for major contracts and the quality of enterprise-wide cost information available to DOE managers and key stakeholders. DOE and NNSA made changes that strengthened oversight of large capital asset projects. These changes helped NNSA better identify cost and schedule problems affecting the MOX project and contributed to NNSA's decision to terminate the project in October 2018. DOE requires that project management staff document and share project management lessons learned on capital asset projects like MOX but",
    "gao_GAO-18-473": "Why GAO Did This Study The San Francisco Bay Delta and its San Joaquin Delta Estuaries are the largest in North America, and they are the subject of political and legal battles over multiple water demands. GAO was asked to review the watershed. This report examines (1) the extent to which federal and nonfederal entities coordinate restoration efforts in the watershed, (2) the extent to which federal and nonfederal entities have developed goals and approaches to assess progress for restoration efforts in the watershed, and (3) the extent to which federal and nonfederal entities identify factors that may limit or pose a risk to restoration efforts. GAO reviewed relevant federal and nonfederal agreements and reports, surveyed federal and nonfederal entities, and interviewed federal and nonfederal officials. What GAO Found Federal and nonfederal entities, including state agencies and nongovernmental organizations, coordinate comprehensive restoration efforts in the San Francisco Bay Delta and San Joaquin Delta, but federal entities do not coordinate across the watershed. Federal and nonfederal entities coordinate comprehensive restoration efforts in the Bay and Delta through two coordinating bodies\u2014the San Francisco Estuary Partnership and the Delta Plan Interagency Implementation Committee, respectively. In the upper watershed, federal and nonfederal entities do not have a coordinating body for comprehensive restoration efforts, but they do coordinate restoration efforts through plans specific to entities, projects, or restoration topics. In 2009, federal entities first developed an Interim Federal Action Plan for coordinating federal restoration efforts across the entire watershed, but not all of the entities are using the plan. Federal and nonfederal entities have developed measurable goals for comprehensive restoration efforts in the Bay and Delta and for specific restoration efforts in the upper watershed. The coordinating bodies have documented the goals in plans, which often contain action items aimed at achieving those goals. In the upper watershed, the San Francisco Estuary Partnership uses indicators to rate the goals as good, fair, or poor, and in 2015, the partnership rated the overall state of the Delta as in fair to poor condition and the Bay as healthier. Information on the status of all restoration efforts across the watershed, including their accomplishments, is unknown because, while the information is being developed, complete and current information is not being fully collected or reported. Total expenditures for fiscal years 2007 through 2016 are unknown, in part because federal reports do not include complete or reliable data for federal and state expenditures in the",
    "gao_GAO-18-452T": "Why GAO Did This Study FOIA authorizes agencies to withhold information from the public in a variety of ways, including requiring agencies to provide information in a manner that does not harm an interest. GAO was asked to review agencies' implementation of FOIA. This statement discusses (1) the extent to which selected agencies have implemented FOIA requirements and (2) the extent to which selected agencies have methods to reduce their FOIA request backlogs. This statement is based on a draft report being issued today that is being released today. GAO selected 18 agencies\u2014the Departments of Homeland Security (DHS), Justice, and State; the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA); and the Department of the Interior\u2014based on their missions and FOIA processing. GAO reviewed relevant FOIA requirements and guidance, and interviewed agency officials. What GAO Found The 18 selected agencies GAO reviewed had implemented the majority of the six Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requirements evaluated. Specifically, 18 agencies updated response letters, implemented tracking systems, provided FOIA training, and published timely and comprehensive regulations. However, 5 of the agencies published and updated their FOIA regulations in a timely and comprehensive manner. The 18 agencies GAO reviewed had FOIA request backlogs of varying sizes, ranging from no backlogged requests at some agencies to 45,000 or more requests at other agencies. Generally, the agencies with the largest backlogs had received the most requests. In an effort to aid agencies in reducing their backlogs, Justice's Office of Information Policy (OIP) identified key practices that agencies can use. However, few of the agencies managed to reduce their backlogs during the period from fiscal year 2012 through 2016. In particular, of the four agencies with the largest backlogs, only one\u2014NARA\u2014reduced its backlog. Agencies attributed their inability to decrease backlogs to the number and complexity of requests, among other factors. However, agencies also lack comprehensive plans to implement practices on an ongoing basis. During fiscal years 2010 through 2016, agencies claimed 237 statutes as the basis for withholding information. Of these statutes, 75 were included on Justice's list of qualifying statutes under the (b)(3) exemption. Of these statutes, 86 lacked the required statutory text that cited the (b)(3) exemption. Justice has not",
    "gao_GAO-18-410": "Why GAO Did This Study The Long Island Sound Improvement Act of 1990 required the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to develop a comprehensive conservation and management plan for the Sound. The act also required the Study to report biennially on progress made in implementing the plan. GAO was asked to review the restoration effort. This report examines (1) what is known about the progress made toward achieving the 1994 plan; (2) the goals of the 2015 plan and factors that may hinder progress according to Study members; (3) how Study members plan to measure and report on progress toward the goals of the 2015 plan; and (4) what Study members expended on restoration activities in fiscal years 2012 through 2016. GAO analyzed the 1994 plan and most recent reports, and interviewed Study members and other stakeholders. What GAO Found Although the Long Island Sound Comprehensive Conservation and Management Plan (the 1994 plan) has collected a wide range of data to measure the health of Long Island Sound and has issued periodic progress reports since 2001, these reports have not contained a comprehensive assessment of progress toward the goals of the 1994 plan. In the absence of a comprehensive assessment of progress, Study members GAO interviewed said that they believe that moderate progress has been made toward goals associated with five of the six priority problems identified in the 1994 plan. The 1994 plan identified six priority problems and created associated goals. In the absence of a comprehensive assessment of progress, Study members GAO interviewed said that they believe that moderate progress has been made toward goals associated with five of the six priority problems. The 2015 plan has four goals to improve water quality and ecosystem functions in the Sound and its surrounding watershed. Each goal is associated with one of four broad themes: clean water and healthy watersheds, thriving habitats and wildlife, sustainable and resilient communities, and sound science and inclusive management. Study members said that numerous factors may hinder progress toward achieving the goals of the 2015 plan, including insufficient funding, climate change, insufficient scientific understanding or data-related issues, development and population growth, and insufficient public appreciation of the Sound. Study members said that they plan to use 20 long-term targets with associated indicators to measure progress toward the goals of the 2015 plan. While 18 of the long-term targets currently have numerical goals, they do not yet have associated intermediate targets that can be used to monitor progress; but EPA officials said that the Study is working to establish them. In March 2018, the Study issued web pages for each of the 20 targets to report on progress",
    "gao_GAO-19-103": "Why GAO Did This Study FMD is a highly contagious viral disease that causes fever and painful lesions on cloven-hoofed animals' hooves, mouths, and udders. The United States has not had an FMD outbreak since 1929, but the disease could be introduced here from countries in Africa, Asia, Eastern Europe, or South America where it is present. USDA is the lead agency for responding to outbreaks of foreign animal diseases, including FMD. GAO was asked to review USDA's FMD response efforts. This report (1) describes USDA's planned approach for responding to FMD outbreaks; (2) identifies what challenges, if any, USDA would face in pursuing its FMD response goals; and (3) examines how USDA identifies, prioritizes, and monitors corrective actions to mitigate these challenges. GAO reviewed USDA documents and interviewed agency officials and others with FMD expertise. GAO also reviewed a nonprobability sample of 29 FMD experts and industry representatives. What GAO Found The U.S. Department of Agriculture's (USDA) planned approach for responding to a foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) outbreak relies on several different strategies emphasizing stamping out, vaccination, or both, depending on factors such as the size of the outbreak. To aid agency officials in implementing the strategies, USDA has developed overarching guidance for responding to animal disease outbreaks and detailed procedures for many response activities. USDA would likely face significant challenges in pursuing its FMD response goals of detecting, controlling, and containing FMD as quickly as possible; eradicating FMD using strategies that seek to stabilize animal agriculture industries and the economy; and facilitating continuity of commerce in uninfected animals. GAO identified 11 challenge areas, based on its review of USDA documents, interviews with agency officials and others with expertise with FMD, and 29 responses to a questionnaire. A majority of respondents indicated that in 10 of the 11 areas USDA would face challenges that are significant\u2014that is, important enough to be worthy of USDA action. For the 11th area, which is communication and coordination, opinions were split on whether the area would present significant challenges. USDA has identified actions to mitigate challenges in responding to FMD, but it has not consistently prioritized or monitored their completion. For example, USDA has identified dozens of corrective actions for FMD preparedness",

GAO was asked to review DOD's CFIUS process. This report assesses (1) DOD's efforts to identify and address national security concerns through CFIUS, and (2) actions DOD has taken to mitigate and monitor transactions through CFIUS. GAO reviewed relevant laws and DOD policies and guidance; analyzed DOD and Treasury data on transactions from 2012 through 2017; and interviewed DOD and Treasury officials. What GAO Found The Department of Defense (DOD) has reviewed hundreds of transactions involving foreign acquirers and U.S. businesses since 2012, but faces several challenges in identifying and addressing national security concerns through the Committee on Foreign Investment in the Unites States (CFIUS) process. These challenges are (1) resources not aligned with an increasing workload; (2) some national security concerns not defined or addressed in DOD's Instruction; (3) some investments that pose national security concerns not always able to be addressed through the CFIUS process; and (4) current component reviewer responsibilities and CFIUS processes not reflected in DOD's Instruction. DOD faces challenges addressing an increasing CFIUS workload with its current resources. For example, DOD's workload has increased from 114 transactions in 2012 to 238 transactions in 2017. DOD also experienced an increase in the cumulative number of mitigation agreements it was responsible for monitoring, more than doubling from 39 in 2012 to 84 in 2017. DOD also faces challenges addressing national security concerns related to the proximity of certain real estate transactions to defense test and training ranges. For example, DOD has not identified transactions that are not voluntarily notified to CFIUS, which can pose national security concerns. DOD is responsible for most CFIUS mitigation agreements, but faces a variety of challenges when taking action to mitigate national security concerns and ensure the effectiveness of the agreements. These challenges relate to insufficient personnel resources compared to an increasing workload, and unclear communication about the delineation of responsibilities between DOD and the components. Moreover, DOD has not reported to Congress on its responsibilities for monitoring and enforcing mitigation agreements. Without updating DOD's guidance to reflect current requirements and",
    "gao_GAO-18-406": "Why GAO Did This Study The Ethics in Government Act of 1978, as amended, provides the Judicial Conference with authority to redact information that could pose a security threat to judicial officials. The judiciary's redaction authority has been used sparingly. GAO was asked to review the judiciary's use of its redaction authority. This report examines the extent to which (1) the judiciary has developed procedures to ensure judicial officials file financial disclosure reports and (2) the judiciary has reported redaction results to Congress in a timely manner. GAO reviewed relevant laws, regulations, and guidance; analyzed data from the judiciary's Committee on Financial Disclosure; and interviewed officials from the judiciary, the U.S. Marshals Service, and the Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts (AOUSC). What GAO Found The Judicial Conference of the United States has developed procedures to ensure judicial officials file their financial disclosure reports, and more than 4,000 reports are filed annually. The judiciary is complying with procedures for responding to requests for redaction reports and the number of reports released has varied from 2012 through 2016. The number of judicial officials who requested redactions represents a small percentage of the total number of financial disclosure reports filed in recent years. For calendar years 2012 through 2016, judicial officials' redaction requests accounted for, on average, 3.2 percent of the total financial disclosure reports filed during this time period. GAO requested copies of the annual redaction reports submitted to Congress for calendar years 2012 through 2016 and determined that AOUSC had not submitted the reports to congressional committees of jurisdiction in a timely manner. Specifically, GAO found that AOUSC submitted the annual report covering 2012 in May 2014 and submitted four annual reports (for calendar years 2013 through 2016) in February and August of 2017, and that AOUSC staff sent a 5-year report to congressional committees of jurisdiction in March 2017 that included information on redaction requests and results for calendar years 2012 through 2016. AOUSC officials acknowledged, though, that they have not implemented a formal process, with designated steps and time frames, to ensure they consistently produce the annual redaction reports in a timely manner.

    "gao_GAO-18-158": "Why GAO Did This Study The Navy plans to spend over $267 billion to design, build, and procure the Columbia class submarine. The Navy expects to spend about $8.7 billion over the next several decades to build the lead submarine. The Navy has requested $8.7 billion for lead ship construction. Congress included a provision in statute for GAO to review the Columbia class program. This report examines (1) the status of key Columbia class technologies and congressional reporting requirements on this status, (2) risks, if any, with the Navy's planned approach for design and construction, and (3) whether expected funding levels for the Columbia class will be adequate moving forward. GAO reviewed program documentation and interviewed relevant officials from the Navy, the Navy's Columbia class program office, and the prime contractor shipyard General Dynamics Electric Boat. What GAO Found The Navy has made progress in reducing technical risks in many areas, such as starting construction of the first Columbia class nuclear reactor, but several key technologies remain immature as the Columbia class program moves into its design phase. These include the integrated power system, nuclear reactor, and propulsor/coordinated stern. While the Navy made progress in some areas\u2014such as prototyping efforts for the missile compartment and nuclear reactor\u2014all of these systems continue to require development and testing to mature them to the point at which GAO's technology readiness guide considers a technology mature. Any challenges in development could put the program at risk of costing more, taking longer to develop, or jeopardizing the program's ability to meet its expected performance requirements. However, the Navy identified only two of the submarine's technologies as \u201ccritical\u201d in the program's 2015 technology readiness assessment (TRA), thereby underrepresenting the technology risk in the program. Underreporting technical risks can hinder Congress' and other decision makers' full understanding of the program's progress. This is especially important because the Navy has already requested $1.6 billion for advanced procurement and recently awarded a detail design contract. Moreover, there is no requirement that the Navy report to Congress on its progress in developing and testing the technologies until after the program completes its production readiness review in May 2020 after the Navy requests another $8.7 billion in funding for the construction of the lead submarine. The Navy is prioritizing design completion before starting construction, which is a good practice that is in accordance with GAO's work on best practices because it helps",
    "gao_GAO-18-137": "Why GAO Did This Study VA is responsible for addressing misconduct at its facilities and programs. GAO was asked to review misconduct at VA. This report examines (1) the extent to which VA collects misconduct and associated disciplinary-action data department-wide, and (2) the extent to which VA has procedures in place to ensure that misconduct cases are handled appropriately. GAO analyzed VA misconduct case files from October 2009 through May 2015, reviewed relevant laws and regulations, and interviewed VA officials. What GAO Found The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) collects misconduct and associated disciplinary-action data department-wide using fragmented information systems. GAO identified 12 fragmented information systems that VA has used, or continues to use, to collect employee misconduct and associated disciplinary actions. GAO's analysis of VA's 14 data files identified three categories that reduced the reliability of the data: lack of data standardization, lack of identifiers, and lack of documentation. GAO's analysis of a generalizable sample of 544 misconduct case files (from a universe of 23,622 files) associated with disciplinary actions that affect pay from October 2009 through May 2015 revealed that VA officials did not consistently adhere to VA's policy for retaining files containing evidence of misconduct. Specifically, VA was unable to provide the files for 10 percent of the files GAO reviewed. Further, GAO found that VA officials did not consistently adhere to VA's policy for documenting that procedures were followed in the adjudication of misconduct cases. GAO also found that VA facility and program offices did not consistently follow policies and procedures established by the Office of Inspector General (OIG) for investigating allegations of misconduct. In several instances, VA facility and program offices did not include one or more of the six elements required in their investigative response to allegations of misconduct. In addition, GAO found instances in which VA facility and program offices did not include sufficient documentation for their findings, or provide a timely response to the OIG. OIG officials stated that they have taken steps to enhance the review of case responses. GAO's review of VA's information systems that track misconduct involving senior officials indicates that they may not always be held accountable for misconduct. Specifically, misconduct was sometimes substantiated, but the proposed disciplinary action was not taken; misconduct was sometimes substantiated, but no disciplinary action was recommended; misconduct was sometimes substantiated",

The Lab's mission is to accelerate development impact by funding and scaling breakthroughs that would accelerate the completion of foreign policy and development goals. GAO was asked to review the Lab. This report examines (1) the Lab's programs, funding, and staffing resources, (2) the extent to which the Lab has documented its oversight of awards with non-USAID contributions and clearly reported these contributions, and (3) the tools that the Lab uses to assess its performance as well as results that such assessments have shown. GAO reviewed and analyzed program, funding, and staffing documents and data from fiscal years 2014 to 2017, and interviewed USAID officials. What GAO Found The Global Development Lab (the Lab) aligns its programs with its five strategic objectives\u2014science, technology, innovation, and partnerships (STIP)\u2014and has decreased funding and staffing since fiscal year 2015. The Lab's five centers, offices, and Lab-Wide Priorities manage more than 25 programs and portfolios, which encompass projects and activities under a specific issue, aligned with the Lab's five strategic objectives. The programs focus on development research (science objective), digital development (technology objective), innovation ventures (innovation objective), and private-sector engagement (partnerships objective). The Lab's obligations of program funds have decreased since fiscal year 2015, from $170.7 million in fiscal year 2015 to $77 million in fiscal year 2017. Similarly, the Lab's obligations of program funds have also decreased since fiscal year 2015, according to Lab data. The number of staff in the Lab has decreased by over 30 percent from fiscal years 2015 through 2018, dropping from 224 in fiscal year 2015 to 155 in fiscal year 2018. The Lab consistently documented certain oversight requirements for non-USAID contributions (i.e., committed, rather than actual, contributions from the private sector, the public sector, and other U.S. government agencies). For all 24 awards GAO reviewed, the Lab consistently documented its compliance with key requirements, such as reporting funding amounts committed from non-USAID sources; documenting partners met cost-share or matching funds, if required; and maintaining copies of the award agreement and any modifications.

    "gao_GAO-18-627": "Why GAO Did This Study In 2007, the federal government issued 89 recommendations to improve the federal acquisition process, including a number of areas related to competition, acquisition workforce, and small business participation. The Section 809 Panel is reporting on a number of topics related to areas covered by the 2007 Panel report, including competition, acquisition workforce, and small business participation. This report identifies actions the federal government has taken to address the key issues the Panel identified in its 2007 report, and some of the acquisition challenges that remain. GAO reviewed relevant legislation, guidance, and reports; analyzed federal procurement data; and interviewed officials from OMB, DOD, GSA, and SBA. What GAO Found The federal government has taken steps to address the key issues the Acquisition Advisory Panel (the Panel) raised in its 2007 report, and some of the acquisition challenges that remain. For example, the Department of Defense (DOD) has struggled to adequately define requirements for its largest acquisition programs. In addition, the General Services Administration (GSA) has taken steps to improve how personnel define requirements for service acquisitions, and to focus more on contractors' deliverables than on how the contractors perform the work. However, officials told GAO that some acquisition officials are reluctant to cede control of the acquisition to contractors. GAO also identified challenges in the federal government's efforts to increase competition and improve pricing. For example, some agencies are using bridge contracts, which GAO has generally defined as extensions to existing contracts or new short-term, sole-source contracts to avoid a lapse in service caused by a delay in awarding a follow-on contract. In some instances, bridge contract awards delay opportunities for competition and can place the government at risk of paying higher prices for multiple years. In response to GAO's recommendations, several agencies have taken steps to improve how they conduct market research and determine price reasonableness. GSA has developed new pricing tools, but is not collecting pricing data as it had planned. GSA officials told GAO pricing data helps contracting officers conduct market research and negotiate prices. The federal government has made significant progress addressing challenges related to interagency contracting, where one agency uses another's contract or contracting support to obtain goods or services. GAO has found that federal agencies' efforts to increase competition and improve pricing have had limited success. For example, in 2009, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) directed agencies to increase competition",

What GAO Found The Administration's fiscal year 2018 plan for verification and monitoring described ongoing interagency efforts to support nuclear proliferation verification and monitoring and includes information about relevant national priorities, capability gaps, research and development (R&D) initiatives, and roles and responsibilities. The 2018 plan (40 pages) is longer and more detailed than the 2015 plan (2 pages) or the 2017 update (4 pages). The bulk of the 2018 plan is contained in two chapters\u2014one chapter broadly describes U.S. and international efforts and roles and responsibilities, and the other chapter describes ongoing U.S. R&D efforts. GAO found that the Administration's 2018 plan generally addressed the reporting requirements called for in the fiscal year 2018 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA), but did not identify costs and funding needs as required by the NDAA. The plan provided detail on verification, detection, and monitoring requirements and roles and responsibilities, but did not provide details on future costs and funding needed to support the activities in the plan. For example, the plan identified requirements for verification, detection, and monitoring as required. However, the plan did not identify costs and funding needs over a 10-year period. NNSA officials stated that they believed providing funding information over a 10-year period is unrealistic for several reasons. First, according to NNSA officials, it is not feasible to achieve agreement on actual or implied budgets outside of the existing President's budget process. Second, according to NNSA officials, agencies have little influence over the funding priorities of other departments outside of existing budget efforts. Third, according to NNSA officials, long-term funding estimates are infeasible because the President's budget only identifies funding levels five years into the future. According to NNSA officials, they verified with the congressional committees that providing such information in the plan would be impractical. By including in its plan",
    "gao_GAO-18-376": "Why GAO Did This Study In fiscal year 2017, the number of children placed in foster care increased by over 10 percent, and states reported that they faced challenges recruiting and retaining foster families. GAO was asked to review states' efforts to recruit and retain foster families. This report examines (1) how state child welfare agencies recruit foster families, including those who provide therapeutic foster care services, (2) challenges, if any, to recruiting and retaining families, and (3) the extent to which the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) provides support to child welfare agencies in their efforts to recruit and retain foster families. GAO surveyed state child welfare agencies in the 50 states and the District of Columbia, and interviewed officials from child welfare agencies, private providers, and foster parents in three selected states (California, Georgia, and Indiana). GAO also interviewed foster parents in eight of the eight foster parent groups selected based on foster parents' experiences providing foster care services. What GAO Found In response to a GAO survey, state child welfare agencies in three selected states\u2014California, Georgia, and Indiana\u2014used a range of strategies to recruit foster families, including conducting outreach, targeting certain populations, and obtaining referrals from current foster families. In the three selected states, child welfare officials and all 14 private providers said they use referrals from current foster families to recruit new foster families. In the three selected states, child welfare officials and all 14 private providers said they use referrals from current foster families to recruit new foster families. In the three selected states, child welfare officials and all 14 private providers said they use referrals from current foster families to recruit new foster families. In the three selected states, child welfare officials and all 14 private providers said they use referrals from current foster families to recruit new foster families. In the three selected states, child welfare officials and all 14 private providers said they collaborated to recruit foster families, and discussed the benefits of using private providers to recruit and retain these families. In response to GAO's survey, 34 states reported that limited resources to focus on foster family recruitment made their recruitment efforts moderately or very challenging. In the three selected states, child welfare officials raised concerns about their ability to prioritize foster family recruitment efforts, given large increases in their foster care caseloads and other demands for resources. In response to GAO's survey, 29 states reported that inadequate support for foster families from the child welfare",
    "gao_GAO-19-102": "Why GAO Did This Study DOD's MHS provides health care to 9.4 million eligible individuals, including active and reserve personnel. DOD's total workforce comprises three main components: military personnel (including active and reserve personnel), federal civilian personnel, and private sector contractor personnel. GAO was asked to review DOD's MHS workforce. This report addresses the extent to which the military departments' planning process for operational medical personnel requirements have assessed the mix of federal civilian, contractor, active, and reserve personnel (i.e., workforce mix). GAO compared the military departments' efforts in planning for operational medical personnel requirements to DOD and department-level policies and guidance on workforce mix determination and identifying the full cost of military personnel. GAO also reviewed DOD and department-level policies and guidance on workforce mix determination and identifying the full cost of military personnel. GAO also interviewed officials from the military departments and the Defense Health Agency (DHA), which manages the MHS. What GAO Found The military departments each have their own process to determine their operational medical personnel requirements. After determining the number of medical personnel needed to support operational needs, the military departments generally consider only military personnel when conducting their planning processes to meet these requirements, and have not formally assessed the extent to which federal civilians and contractors could be utilized to fill these positions. Further, the departments do not generally consider the full cost of active and reserve component medical personnel when determining their balance of active and reserve component medical personnel, and they have not developed such information to use in their assessment of active and reserve balance. The military departments have taken actions, such as establishing policies and procedures, to aid the execution of the appropriate workforce mix for providing beneficiary health care within military treatment facilities (MTFs). However, the military departments face challenges in executing their plans in several areas, including lengthy hiring and contracting processes and uncompetitive salaries and contractor compensation. Further, the transfer of administrative responsibility for MTFs from the military departments to the DHA may present challenges to the management of the military medical personnel. Historically, each military department has been responsible for managing its military personnel to ensure it meets its operational mission and appropriately staffs its MTFs, and the challenge of balancing these missions was the responsibility of each respective military department. However, the transfer of administrative responsibility for MTFs from the military departments to the DHA will separate these missions\u2014the operational mission will be the responsibility",

CMS is responsible for ensuring that Medicaid is managed effectively and efficiently, and that beneficiaries receive appropriate care. CMS has reported that improper payments have increased from about $36.7 billion in fiscal year 2011 to $36.7 billion in fiscal year 2017. GAO was asked to review CMS's efforts to use T-MSIS data. This report examines (1) the extent to which states are reporting T-MSIS data, and CMS's efforts to improve the quality of T-MSIS data; and (2) the extent to which T-MSIS data are complete and comparable across states. GAO reviewed CMS documents and interviewed CMS officials and selected states. GAO also reviewed selected states' documentation of unreported data elements, and interviewed officials from CMS and eight selected states. What GAO Found As of November 2017, 49 states have begun reporting data from the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services' (CMS) Medicaid Management Information Systems (T-MSIS) initiative, a significant increase from the 18 states that had started reporting these data in October 2016. These states represent over 97 percent of the 2017 Medicaid population nationwide. CMS officials told GAO that they expect all states to report T-MSIS data by 2018. Selected states identified converting their data to the T-MSIS format as a significant reporting challenge. In some cases, before converting their data to the T-MSIS format, states had to obtain data they had not previously collected from other state entities, managed care organizations (MCO), or providers. CMS updated the T-MSIS data dictionary in 2013 and again in November 2015. Some of the selected states reported that the changes included in this update required considerable rework, and in some cases, delayed their T-MSIS reporting. CMS has relied on a variety of mechanisms to support states' efforts to report T-MSIS data. CMS assigned technical assistants to help states understand the T-MSIS requirements, prioritize steps to report T-MSIS data, and serve as a resource on technical issues. The majority of selected states had positive comments about the technical assistance they received. CMS has shifted its efforts to improving the quality of T-MSIS data reported, and these efforts are still evolving. For example, CMS created an online \"operational dashboard\" for each state, which provides specific information on errors in its",

Recovery housing is generally not considered to be residential treatment centers, not eligible to be licensed providers for the purposes of billing private insurance or public programs, and residents typically have to pay rent and other housing expenses themselves. GAO was asked to review the prevalence of recovery housing. This report examines (1) the prevalence of recovery housing in the United States, (2) actions taken by selected states to investigate and oversee recovery housing, and (3) the extent to which SAMHSA and state funding can be used for recovery housing. GAO reviewed relevant laws and regulations, and interviewed officials from SAMHSA and five states selected based on their experience with regulating recovery housing. GAO also reviewed relevant laws and regulations and interviewed officials from five state agencies that administer SAMHSA and state funding for recovery housing. What GAO Found The nationwide prevalence of recovery housing is unknown because there are no comprehensive data regarding the number of recovery homes in the United States, although the National Association of Recovery Residences (NARR) and Oxford House, Inc. collect data on a subset of recovery homes across the United States. NARR collects data only on recovery homes that seek certification from one of its 15 state affiliates that certify homes. However, NARR-certified homes may represent only a portion of existing recovery homes, as NARR does not know how many such homes are uncertified. As of January 2018, NARR reported that its affiliates had certified almost 2,000 recovery homes, which had the capacity to provide housing to over 25,000 individuals. NARR-certified recovery homes include recovery housing across all four NARR levels, including residential treatment centers that provide clinical services, which are outside the scope of GAO's study. The five states GAO reviewed have taken actions to investigate and oversee recovery housing. Four of the five states have conducted, or are in the process of conducting, law enforcement investigations of recovery homes in their states and some of these investigations have resulted in arrests and changes to public and private insurance policies. In addition to actions taken in response to state investigations, three of the five states in GAO's review have also taken steps to formally enhance their oversight of recovery homes, and the other two states have taken other steps intended to increase consistency, accountability, and quality across recovery homes.

    "gao_GAO-18-530": "Why GAO Did This Study DOD spends over $1 million annually on commercial items, which are items developed for the government. The National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2016 included a provision for GAO to review DOD's commercial item and price reasonableness determinations. This report (1) identifies the factors that influenced DOD's commercial item and price reasonableness determinations and (2) assesses the extent to which DOD has taken steps to make information available to help make these determinations. GAO reviewed relevant legislation, guidance, and DOD guidance; analyzed a non-generalizable sample of 56 contracts for commercial items; and interviewed DOD contracting and pricing officials. What GAO Found In the case studies GAO examined, GAO found four interrelated factors that influenced how the Department of Defense (DOD) determines whether an item is commercial and whether the price is fair and reasonable. For example, when a contractor asserted that two small engine parts\u2014provided by a subcontractor\u2014were commercial, the contracting officer found no similar services available in the commercial marketplace. In contrast, for a previous report on commercial item acquisitions, GAO reviewed selected Air Force contracts for information technology services and video teleconferencing design and installation. Because these items and services are available in the commercial marketplace, the availability of information helped the contracting officers efficiently determine that the items were commercial and that the prices were fair and reasonable. Contracting officials from GAO's case studies had difficulty obtaining information from contractors after they could not find adequate information in the marketplace. For example, in a $1.7 billion Army sole-source contract for helicopter engines, the prime contractor asserted that two small engine parts\u2014provided by a subcontractor\u2014were commercial, but did not provide any documents to support its assertion. After several months of back and forth, the contractor provided invoices for similar services, which the contracting officer used to determine price reasonableness. In another case, the contractor provided invoices for similar services, which the contracting officer used to determine price reasonableness. In one case, the contractor provided redacted invoices and quotes from a subcontractor, which the contracting officer considered insufficient to support a commercial item or price reasonableness determination. In another case, the contractor provided redacted invoices and quotes, which the contracting officer considered insufficient to support a commercial",

The Coast Guard has been implementing a health care system for its nearly 50,000 members since the agency's inception in 2010. This testimony discusses (1) the Coast Guard's decision to terminate the Health Care Information System (IHiS) project in October 2015, (2) the challenges that the Coast Guard is managing in managing and maintaining paper health records, and (3) the Coast Guard's efforts to acquire a new electronic health record system. This statement is based on GAO's report being released today (GAO-08-282). GAO reviewed Coast Guard documents and interviewed agency officials. What GAO Found The Coast Guard terminated the IHiS project in October 2015, after spending approximately $60 million on the project. According to the Director of the Health Care Information Technology (HSWL) Directorate, who was appointed to the position in August 2015, financial, technical, schedule, and personnel risks led the Coast Guard's Executive Oversight Council to decide to terminate the IHiS project in October 2015: Financial risks. Internal investigations were initiated in January 2015 and May 2015 to determine whether the HSWL Directorate had violated the Antideficiency Act by using incorrect funding sources and incorrect fiscal year funds for the IHiS project. The Coast Guard ordered project management and contractor staff to cease work on IHiS until a determination was made regarding the antideficiency violation. Technical risks. The HSWL Directorate stated that the Defense Health Agency team projected the timeline for the first clinic implementation to be approximately 1 year later than originally estimated due, in part, to incomplete interfaces and workflows. Personnel risks. Although HSWL staff had been managing the IHiS project since it was initiated in 2010, Command, Control, Communications, Computers, and Information Technology (C4&IT) was directed to assume the oversight responsibilities for IHiS implementation in May 2015. This action was due, in part, to concerns about the project's adherence to established governance processes raised by the internal investigator",

FEMA's IA program provides financial and direct assistance to disaster victims for expenses and needs that cannot be met through other means, such as insurance. GAO was asked to review FEMA's IA program. This report examines (1) the number of IA declaration requests made, declared, and denied by FEMA regions and states, and (2) the extent to which FEMA regions and states consider the regulatory factors used to assess IA declaration requests. GAO analyzed FEMA data on IA declaration requests from 2008 through 2016, reviewed FEMA regulations, and interviewed FEMA officials in 10 FEMA regions and 11 states selected based on the number of IA declaration requests received and the type of disaster. What GAO Found The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) received 294 Individual Assistance (IA) declaration requests from calendar years 2008 through 2016, with total IA obligations of approximately $8.6 billion. Of these, the President declared 168 requests (57 percent), and 51 percent of these declarations were from FEMA's regions.

FEMA received 294 IA declaration requests from calendar years 2008 through 2016, of which the President declared 168 requests (57 percent), and 51 percent of these declarations were from FEMA's regions. FEMA obligated a total of approximately $8.6 billion in IA for disaster declarations made from calendar years 2008 through 2016. These obligations were provided to 46 states and they ranged from less than $1 million to more than $1 billion. FEMA regions varied in how they considered the six regulatory factors used to assess states' or tribes' IA declaration requests. For example, FEMA regions reported using all six regulatory factors when evaluating states' or tribes' IA declaration requests. Officials from the other 4 regions reported using five of the six factors, with the exception being the average amount of individual assistance by state factor. These officials noted that they do not use this factor because FEMA considers the factor to be outdated or they consider all of the factors holistically. Officials from FEMA's regional offices also generally reported that the extent to which they consider the six",

FEMA's PA appeals process is a complex and multistep program that involves a review process between FEMA and the state. GAO was asked to review FEMA's PA appeals program. This report examines (1) the extent to which FEMA ensures quality in its data on appeals and what FEMA data show about its appeals inventory and timeliness for appeals decisions; (2) steps FEMA has taken to improve its management of the appeals process and what challenges, if any, remain; and (3) the extent to which FEMA has developed goals and measures to assess the appeal program's performance. GAO analyzed FEMA data on appeals received between January 2014 and July 2017, and interviewed FEMA officials in headquarters and three FEMA regional offices selected based on their appeals processing workloads and appeals staffing. What GAO Found GAO's review of the Federal Emergency Management Agency's (FEMA) appeals data showed weaknesses in the agency's data quality practices that affect program oversight. For example, GAO found that FEMA regional offices do not consistently report first-level appeals data consistently or update this data regularly, resulting in missing data entries. Further, GAO found that FEMA's appeal tracking process does not ensure data quality, limiting FEMA's ability to use the data for making decisions on and improvements to the PA appeals process. During GAO's review, FEMA officials acknowledged these data quality issues and provided GAO with corrected data to address these discrepancies. GAO's analysis of the corrected data showed that, between January 2014 and July 2017, FEMA received over 1,445 first- and second-level appeals with amounts in dispute totaling about $1.5 billion. Across all years, first-level appeals accounted for the majority of appeals, though the number of appeals fluctuated widely each year. Over the same period, only a small percentage of first-and second-level appeals were processed within the 90-day statutory time frame required by statute. FEMA has taken steps to improve its management of the appeals process and respond to issues raised by GAO and the Department of Homeland Security's Office of Inspector General related to processing delays.

The Navy and the Marine Corps have identified personnel requirements for three systems, but the sufficiency of requirements for four other systems is yet undetermined. The Navy and the Marine Corps have not updated personnel requirements and the related cost estimate for the RQ-21 Blackjack Unmanned Aerial System (UAS) based on deployment data. Without updating personnel requirements, the Navy and the Marine Corps may not have current information about the number of operators needed for the RQ-21 Blackjack UAS. The Navy and the Marine Corps have made some positive steps, but have not fully evaluated and updated their aviation policies for operation and maintenance of certain unmanned systems to inform the development of future personnel requirements. Navy officials stated that applying certain procedures and standards from these policies equally across different sizes of UAS is problematic for group 3 UAS in particular, which includes the RQ-21 Blackjack. Without such clarity about personnel-related goals and priority levels, the services will be hampered in developing future personnel requirements and identifying risks as system inventories grow and operations expand.

The JWST project completed its third and fourth of five total integration and test phases for the combined optical telescope element and integrated science instrument module (OTIS) and the spacecraft elements, respectively. Previously, the project and its contractor completed the Integrated Science Instrument Module and the Optical Telescope Element integration phases in March 2016. The project and its contractor conducted risk reduction testing on OTIS and the spacecraft elements to reduce risk for challenging environmental tests on flight hardware.

    "gao_GAO-18-611T": "Why GAO Did This Study In fiscal year 2016, FNS served 149 million meals to children through its SFSP program. FNS is responsible for administering the program and overseeing the program's operations. This testimony discusses (1) the number of SFSP meals served nationwide during the summer, (2) the extent to which other federal and nonfederal programs helped feed low-income children in the summer, and (3) challenges states and SFSP providers reported in implementing the program. This statement is based on GAO's May 2018 report, Food for Low-Income Children: Federal and Nonfederal Programs Helped Feed Low-Income Children in the Summer (GAO-2018-08-28). GAO reviewed FNS data on SFSP meals served nationwide from 2007 through 2016, and interviewed FNS officials and national organizations. What GAO Found The total number of Supplemental Food for School Program (SFSP) meals served nationwide during the summer\u2014one indicator of program participation\u2014increased from 113 million meals in fiscal year 2007 to 149 million meals in fiscal year 2016, or by 32 percent. Although almost half of the total increase in meals served in the summer months was due to increases in lunches, when comparing across each of the meal types, supper and breakfast had the largest percentage increases over the 10-year period, 50 and 48 percent, respectively. The increase in SFSP meals over this time period was generally consistent with increases in the number of meals served in the National School Lunch Program (NSLP), the largest child nutrition assistance program, during this period. Although FNS clarified its instructions in May 2017 to help improve the consistency of states' statewide estimates of children's participation in SFSP, ADA, even if consistently calculated, remained an unreliable estimate of children's daily participation in SFSP for at least two reasons. First, ADA did not account for existing variation in the number of days that each site serves meals to children. Second, ADA did not account for state variation in the month with the greatest number of SFSP meals served. According to FNS officials, the agency instructed states to calculate ADA for July because officials identified this as the month with the largest number of meals served nationwide. However, according to GAO's analysis of nationwide FNS data, in summer 2016, 26 states served more SFSP meals in June or August than in July",
    "gao_GAO-18-114": "Why GAO Did This Study The growth of e-commerce has greatly increased the likelihood of businesses selling to out-of-state customers. In 1992, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in Quill Corp. v. North Dakota that a state can only require a business to collect and remit sales tax if the business has substantial presence, referred to as nexus, in that state. However, the decision stated that Congress could pass legislation to overrule the Quill decision. GAO was asked to review the potential revenue gains states could gain by collecting taxes on sales made by all remote sellers. This report examines (1) the extent to which state and local governments can require remote sellers to collect taxes on all sales, (2) the costs associated with collecting taxes on all remote sales, and (3) strategies that could mitigate these concerns. GAO analyzed state and local sales tax data, reviewed relevant literature, and interviewed state and local officials. What GAO Found GAO estimates that state and local governments can, under current law, require remote sellers to collect about 75 to 80 percent of the taxes that would be owed if all remote sellers were required to collect tax on all remote sales at current rates. GAO estimates that about 80 percent of the potential revenue from requiring all Internet retailers to collect is already collectible. For business-to-consumer (B2C) remote sales, GAO estimates that the percentage of taxes already being collected by sellers was generally higher for Internet retailers than for other types of remote sellers like catalog retailers or e-marketplaces. GAO estimates that about half of potential revenue gains to state and local governments would result from collecting sales taxes on all e-marketplace sales. To date, e-marketplaces have not been obligated to collect state sales taxes on behalf of sellers. Instead, like with all remote sellers, individual sellers who have title to the goods being sold through an e-marketplace are required to collect tax on sales to states in which they have nexus. However, GAO identified two states that have recently taken action to attribute a collection obligation to the e-marketplace. Through GAO's review of tax industry publications and interviews with tax practitioners, GAO learned that some individual sellers have difficulty obtaining information from the e-marketplace companies on where their goods might be stored. While the three large e-marketplaces that G",

In the event of a national emergency, Congress and the President would be required to enact a law authorizing a draft to supplement the existing force with additional military manpower. The National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2017 included a provision for GAO to review DOD's report on the military selective service process. This report examines the extent to which DOD (1) included information on the six required reporting elements in its July 2017 report to Congress and the Commission on the purpose and utility of a registration system for military selective service, and (2) identified additional information that may be useful in supporting the ongoing review of the military selective service process by the Commission. GAO reviewed DOD's July 2017 report and interviewed DOD officials. What GAO Found The Department of Defense (DOD) included information on each of the six required reporting elements in its July 2017 report to Congress and the Commission on the purpose and utility of a registration system for military selective service, as shown in the table below. DOD included information on each of the six required reporting elements in its July 2017 report to Congress and the Commission on the purpose and utility of a registration system for military selective service, as shown in the table below. In preparing the report, officials within the Office of the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Manpower and Reserve Affairs stated that they coordinated and consulted with subject matter experts at the Selective Service System and the Joint Staff as well as with officials from selected organizations within the Office of the Secretary of Defense, including the U.S. Military Entrance Processing Command. Further, the DOD report references internal DOD documents, a policy publication from the Congressional Research Service regarding Selective Service issues, statements from former DOD executives, and publications from contributing authors on web-based foreign policy and national security discussion sites for additional support. While DOD included information on the six required reporting elements in its July 2017 report to Congress and the Commission on the purpose and utility of a registration system for military selective service, GAO identified additional information that may be useful in supporting the ongoing review of the military selective service process by the Commission.

Water utilities employ a broad range of workers, including water operators; engineers; customer service representatives; accountants; legal support; and skilled technical occupations, such as electricians, machinists, and instrument technicians. GAO was asked to review workforce challenges at water utilities. This report examines (1) what is known about workforce needs at water utilities compared with workforce needs nationwide and any effects of potential unmet workforce needs on the utilities' abilities to comply with the Safe Drinking Water Act and the Clean Water Act; (2) what approaches selected water utilities have used to manage their workforce needs and challenges they have faced in managing those needs; and (3) how key federal programs can assist water utilities with their workforce needs. GAO reviewed relevant federal laws and regulations, analyzed EPA compliance data, and interviewed officials from five federal agencies that conduct activities or provide funding related to the water utility workforce. What GAO Found Data available from the Department of Labor's Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) suggest that the workforce replacement needs for water operators are similar to workforce replacement needs nationwide across all occupations. However, little information is available about the current and future effects of any unmet workforce needs on utilities' abilities to comply with the Safe Drinking Water Act and the Clean Water Act. BLS projects that there will be 9,200 job openings for water operators between 2016 and 2026. However, little information is available about the current and future effects of any unmet workforce needs on utilities' abilities to comply with the Safe Drinking Water Act and the Clean Water Act. The most recent BLS projections indicate that the replacement needs for water operators\u2014resulting from retirement or other separations\u2014are relatively similar to the projected national average of replacement needs across all occupations (8.2 percent versus 10.9 percent, respectively). However, little information is available about the current and future effects of any unmet workforce needs on utilities' abilities to comply with the Safe Drinking Water Act and the Clean Water Act. At a national level, neither the water utilities' industry associations nor EPA has analyzed whether there is a relationship between unmet workforce needs and compliance problems. Some water utility industry associations have analyzed projected employee retirement eligibility and employee turnover, but these studies did not analyze the potential effect of these retirements on utilities' operations.

Section 192(c) of title 10 of the United States Code required DOD to periodically review the continuing need for its DAFAs, and whether the provision of services and supplies by the DAFAs, rather than by the military departments, is more effective, economical, and efficient. GAO was asked to review DOD's efforts to assess the continuing need for the DAFAs. This report evaluates the extent to which (1) DOD has assessed the continuing need for each defense agency and DOD field activity (DAFA); (2) any overlap or fragmentation among the DAFAs that provide human resources services has affected the delivery of those services; and (3) DOD has monitored and evaluated the results of its efficiency initiatives that affect the DAFAs. GAO reviewed DOD's biennial reports on the DAFAs from 1987 to 2012, the most recent year of DOD's reporting, and the most recent DOD reports on combat support agencies, as required by section 192(c). GAO also interviewed DOD officials and analyzed documents detailing the human resources service customer bases of the three DAFAs that provide human resources services. What GAO Found The Department of Defense (DOD) has not comprehensively or routinely assessed the continuing need for its DAFAs, and its efforts to assess the DAFAs have been neither comprehensive nor routine. At the time of GAO's review, section 192(c) of title 10 of the United States Code required DOD to periodically review the services and supplies each DAFA provides to ensure that (1) there is a continuing need for each DAFA; and (2) the provision of services and supplies by each DAFA, rather than by the military departments, is a more effective, economical, or efficient manner of providing those services and supplies or of meeting the requirements for combat readiness. DOD's biennial reports on the DAFAs from 1987 to 2012 did not generally reflect key elements of quality evaluations, which GAO identified in prior work and compiled as part of this review.

CMS has a goal of reducing the risk of opioid use disorder, overdoses, and abuse. GAO was asked to review CMS's oversight of opioid prescribing. This statement discusses (1) CMS's oversight of beneficiaries who receive opioids, and (2) CMS's oversight of providers who prescribe opioids to Medicare Part D beneficiaries. This statement is based on GAO's October 2017 report, Medicare Part D: Overutilization Monitoring System (GAO-17-92). GAO reviewed CMS guidance and data on beneficiaries who received opioids, and interviewed CMS officials. What GAO Found The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) delegated monitoring of beneficiaries who receive opioids to plan sponsors, but did not have sufficient information on those most at risk for harm. CMS created the Overutilization Monitoring System (OMS) in 2013 to identify beneficiaries with high-risk use of opioids, and to oversee sponsors' compliance with CMS's opioid overutilization policy. CMS also reported a 61 percent decrease from calendar years 2011 through 2016 in the number of beneficiaries meeting the OMS criteria of high risk\u2014from 29,404 to 11,594 beneficiaries\u2014which agency officials considered an indication of success toward its goal of decreasing opioid use disorder. However, CMS did not have comparable information on most beneficiaries who receive high doses of opioids\u2014regardless of the number of providers and pharmacies used\u2014and who therefore may be at risk for harm, according to CDC's 2016 guidelines. These guidelines noted that long-term use of high doses of opioids\u2014those above a MED of 90 mg per day\u2014are associated with significant risk of harm and should be avoided if possible. CMS has revised its current OMS criteria to include more at-risk beneficiaries beginning in 2018. However, CMS did not keep track of the total number of these beneficiaries, and did not have plans to do so as part of OMS. GAO also found that CMS oversees providers who prescribe opioids to Medicare Part D beneficiaries through its contractor and plan sponsors. CMS required the contractor to identify providers who prescribe high amounts of opioids, which include but are not limited to opioids. CMS's guidance focused broadly on prescription drugs, and did not specifically address opioids",

CMS is the largest provider of health insurance in the United States, with outlays projected to rise to $1.5 trillion in 2028. GAO has reported on the vulnerability of Medicare and Medicaid programs to fraud, waste, and abuse. This testimony discusses (1) CMS's efforts to manage fraud risks in Medicare and (2) CMS's efforts to develop an antifraud strategy for Medicare. This statement is based on GAO's December 2017 report, Medicare: CMS Needs to Fully Align its Antifraud Efforts with the Fraud Risk Framework (GAO-17-710) and its March 2018 letter to GAO. GAO reviewed relevant federal laws, regulations, and guidance; analyzed CMS fraud risk assessments and antifraud strategies; and interviewed CMS officials. What GAO Found The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services' (CMS) antifraud efforts partially aligned with the Fraud Risk Framework. Consistent with the framework, CMS has demonstrated commitment to combating fraud by creating a dedicated entity to lead antifraud efforts. CMS has also taken steps to establish a culture conducive to fraud risk management, although it could expand its antifraud training to include all employees. CMS has taken steps to identify fraud risks in Medicare, but it has not conducted a fraud risk assessment or developed a risk-based antifraud strategy for Medicare as defined in the Fraud Risk Framework. Such a risk assessment would provide the detailed information and insights needed to create a fraud risk profile, which, in turn, is the basis for creating an antifraud strategy. CMS has taken steps to identify fraud risks in Medicare, but it has not conducted a fraud risk assessment for Medicare as defined in the Fraud Risk Framework. Such a risk assessment would help CMS identify all sources of fraudulent behaviors, beyond threats posed by providers, such as those posed by health-insurance plans, contractors, or employees. Without a fraud risk assessment, CMS cannot be certain that it is aware of the most-significant fraud risks facing this program and what risks it is willing to tolerate based on the program's size and complexity. Using a fraud risk assessment for Medicare and closely examining existing fraud control activities and prioritizing residual fraud risks, CMS could be better",

IPERA also requires agencies to submit a plan to Congress describing the actions they will take to achieve compliance. GAO was asked to review the extent to which CFO Act agencies reported as noncompliant for 3 or more consecutive years. This report examines (1) the extent to which CFO Act agencies complied with the six criteria listed in IPERA, and the trends evident since 2011, as reported by their inspectors general (IG); (2) the extent to which CFO Act agencies addressed requirements for programs and activities reported as noncompliant with IPERA criteria for 3 or more consecutive years, as of fiscal year 2016, and communicated their strategies to Congress for reducing improper payments and achieving compliance; and (3) the extent to which OMB made determinations regarding whether additional funding would help CFO Act programs and activities reported as noncompliant for 2 consecutive years, as of fiscal years 2016 and 2017, come into compliance. GAO analyzed agency and IG data, reviewed relevant guidance, and interviewed agency and OMB staff. What GAO Found Seven years after the initial implementation of the Improper Payments Elimination and Recovery Act of 2010 (IPERA), over half of the 24 Chief Financial Officers Act (CFO Act) agencies were reported as noncompliant by their inspectors general (IG) for fiscal years 2016 and 2017. Specifically, 13 agencies were reported as noncompliant with one or more IPERA criteria for fiscal year 2016, and 14 agencies were reported as noncompliant for fiscal year 2017 (see figure). Nine of these agencies have been reported as noncompliant in one or more programs every year since IPERA was implemented in 2011. Almost a third (18 programs) of the 58 programs that contributed to 14 CFO Act agencies' noncompliance under IPERA, as of fiscal year 2017, were reported as noncompliant for 3 or more consecutive years. The number of programs reported as noncompliant for 3 or more consecutive years has continually increased since fiscal year 2015, from 12 programs (associated with 7 agencies) to 18 programs (associated with 9 agencies) as of fiscal years 2016 and 2017, respectively.

The Navy's use of virtual training devices has increased over time, and advances in technology have resulted in the acquisition of simulators and simulations with additional capabilities designed to help individual Marines and units acquire and refine skills through more concentrated and repetitive training. This testimony discusses the extent to which the Navy and Marine Corps have (1) completed required training for amphibious operations priorities and (2) identified and addressed training shortfalls. This testimony is based on GAO's September 2017 report, Amphibious Operations: The Navy and Marine Corps Have Taken Some Steps to Identify and Address Training Shortfalls, but These Efforts Are Incomplete ( GAO-17-45, Sept. 30, 2017). This testimony is based on GAO's September 2017 report, Amphibious Operations: The Navy and Marine Corps Have Taken Some Steps to Identify and Address Training Shortfalls, but These Efforts Are Incomplete ( GAO-17-45, Sept. 30, 2017). GAO reviewed the Navy and Marine Corps' training certifications and readiness data from fiscal year 2014 through 2016, and interviewed officials from 23 Marine Corps units. What GAO Found In its September 2017 report, GAO found that the Navy and Marine Corps units completed required training for amphibious operations, but the Marine Corps has been unable to consistently accomplish training for other service amphibious operations priorities. Specifically, based on GAO's review of deployment certification messages from 2014 through 2016, GAO found that each deploying Navy Amphibious Ready Group completed training for the amphibious operations mission in accordance with training standards. However, GAO also reported that based on its review of unit-level readiness data from fiscal year 2014 through 2016, Marine Corps units were unable to fully accomplish training for other amphibious operations priorities. These shortfalls include home-station unit training to support contingency requirements, service-level exercises, and experimentation and concept development for amphibious operations.

CMS oversees providers who prescribe opioids to Medicare beneficiaries through its contractor, NBI MEDIC, and the Part D plan sponsors. GAO was asked to review CMS's oversight of providers who prescribe opioids. This report examines (1) CMS's oversight of providers who prescribe opioids to Medicare beneficiaries and (2) CMS's oversight of providers who prescribe opioids to Medicare beneficiaries. GAO reviewed CMS guidance and data on beneficiaries' use of opioids, and interviewed CMS officials and six plan sponsors selected to represent a range of health insurance plans and pharmacy benefit managers. What GAO Found The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS), within the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), oversees providers who prescribe opioids to Medicare beneficiaries through its contractor, the National Institute for Medicare & Medicaid Services (BNI MEDIC), and the Part D plan sponsors. CMS provides guidance to plan sponsors on how they should monitor opioid overutilization problems among beneficiaries. CMS also created the Overutilization Monitoring System (OMS), which outlines criteria to identify beneficiaries with high-risk use of opioids and to oversee sponsors' compliance with CMS's opioid overutilization policy. CMS also uses patient safety measures to assess how well plan sponsors are monitoring beneficiaries and taking appropriate actions. CMS tracks the total number of beneficiaries who meet all three OMS criteria as part of its opioid overutilization oversight across the Part D program, but it does not have comparable information on most beneficiaries who may be at risk for harm. CMS has goals to reduce the risk of opioid use disorders, overdoses, inappropriate prescribing, and drug diversion in its Opioid Misuse Strategy, but OMS does not track the number of beneficiaries with prescriptions for high doses of opioids unless those beneficiaries are also receiving them both from four or more providers and from four or more pharmacies. CMS officials told GAO that CMS has no plans for OMS to begin doing so. Instead, CMS uses the number of beneficiaries who meet the OMS criteria as an indicator of progress toward its goals. CMS estimates that 33,223 beneficiaries would have met its revised criteria based on 2015 data, which is a much smaller number than the estimated 727,016 beneficiaries at risk of harm from opioids.

FTA oversees safety of railroads and rail transit systems, which are a network of standard gage track over which goods may be transported and passengers may travel. The 112th Congress included a provision in the Federal Surface Transportation Reform Act of 2012 that, among other things, provided FTA with authority to issue safety regulations and to establish a state safety oversight program. The act also required GAO to review FTA's oversight of rail transit. This report examines (1) FRA's and FTA's approaches to rail transit safety oversight, and (2) FTA's and FTA's efforts to implement its new authorities. GAO reviewed FRA and FTA documents, interviewed FTA and rail stakeholders, and analyzed FTA and rail safety studies. What GAO Found The Federal Railroad Administration (FRA) and the Federal Transit Administration (FTA) have a more centralized safety oversight program for railroads, while FTA is implementing changes to the rail transit oversight program, established in federal statute, which relies on states to monitor and enforce safety. FRA's safety regulations include minimum safety requirements, though railroads can apply for waivers. FRA's inspections are guided by a risk-based model, which focuses its inspections on locations that, according to FRA's data-driven model, are likely to have safety problems. FRA has hired additional inspectors, going from 347 inspectors in fiscal year 2013 to over 360 currently, out of the nearly 930 full-time equivalent staff agency-wide. FRA and FTA's approaches to their rail safety oversight missions each have strengths and limitations, including how the agencies develop safety regulations, conduct inspections, and carry out enforcement. Compared to FRA's long-standing role in providing safety oversight over railroads, FTA is in the process of implementing significant changes to its program for rail transit safety oversight after being granted new authorities in the Moving Ahead for Progress in the 21st Century Act (MAP-21) and the Federal Surface Transportation Reform Act of 2012. FRA's extensive and well-established safety regulations are a strength of FRA's safety oversight program.

The act also allows tribes to make a sub-recipient request under certain circumstances. GAO was asked to review tribes' experiences requesting and managing disaster declarations. This report examines (1) the factors that influence selected tribes' decisions about how to seek federal assistance through a major disaster declaration and (2) the actions FEMA is taking to assist tribal efforts to request and manage disaster declarations. GAO surveyed 36 tribes that requested or joined a state's request for major disaster declarations from 2013 through 2016 and interviewed officials from FEMA and two national tribal organizations. GAO also visited 7 tribes selected from among the 23 tribes that responded to a survey. What GAO Found According to the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) data, between 2013 and 2016, 36 tribes made requests for disaster assistance as a direct recipient or by joining a state's request. Of those 36 tribes, 17 tribes made a total of 17 direct requests to the President through FEMA for major disaster declarations. Eight of these requests were approved across 7 tribes. Twenty-nine tribes were sub-recipients under 36 state major disaster declaration requests. Eight tribes made a direct request and also joined at least one state request for a major disaster declaration. Tribal officials reported that there are several factors they considered when deciding whether to make a direct request or to join a state's request for a disaster declaration, during the 2013 to 2016 period. Specifically, nine of 10 tribes responding to GAO's survey that made a direct request reported that tribal sovereignty was a major factor they considered when making a direct request. In addition, nine of 10 tribes responding to GAO's survey that made a direct request reported that the clarity of FEMA's policies and guidance was a factor in their decision making. Conversely, eight of the 13 tribes that only joined a state request reported that their concerns about FEMA's policies and guidance were a factor in their decisions. Tribal officials' confidence in the tribe's emergency management capacity was a key factor in determining whether or not to seek a request directly or to join a state's request.",

In 1995, the Department of Transportation (DOT) transferred the office's responsibilities from DOT to FAA. In 2014, Congress moved the Office of the Secretary of Transportation to FAA. GAO was asked to review the potential benefits and disadvantages of moving the office. This report examines (1) stakeholders' perspectives on moving the office and (2) steps that can be taken to move the office. GAO reviewed relevant laws, regulations, and other documents and interviewed officials from FAA, DOT, and the Office of the Secretary of Transportation.

On the other hand, most FAA officials GAO interviewed did not favor the idea. A senior official in the Office of Commercial Space Transportation said that there are advantages and disadvantages to moving the office and that whether such an action would be beneficial depended on the implementation details and the administration's preferences. Officials from the Office of the Secretary of Transportation said they currently do not have plans to move the office.

However, there are no specific statutes or regulations pertaining to Internet firearms transactions. Rather, firearms transactions facilitated by the Internet are subject to the same legal requirements and regulations as traditional firearms sales. GAO was asked to review the Internet's role in facilitating illegal firearm transactions. This report examines (1) how ATF enforces firearm laws related to prohibited firearm transactions facilitated by the Internet, and (2) the extent to which ATF has attempted to illegally purchase firearms on the Surface Web. GAO analyzed ATF documents and interviewed ATF officials and other stakeholders. GAO also conducted covert tests on the Dark Web and Surface Web. What GAO Found The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) does not distinguish between private firearms transactions taking place in person versus those that use the Internet to facilitate the sale. Licensed and nonlicensed sellers use the Internet to facilitate firearm sales in a variety of ways. Major retailers with a federal firearms license enable customers to browse available firearms on their websites but require transactions to be made in person at the store. Online retailers with a federal firearms license advertise firearms online and transfer the firearm to the purchaser through either a storefront that qualifies as an Federal Firearm Licensee (FFL) or another FFL in the buyer's state. Online auction and marketplace websites, online classifieds, and online forums also facilitate sales between buyers and both licensed and nonlicensed sellers. ATF officials said that it is not possible to monitor private firearms transactions coordinated over the Internet as they take place. Federal law does not require the seller in a private firearm transaction to conduct a background check or otherwise process paperwork through ATF. ATF has a number of tools to facilitate Internet-related investigations, including the Internet Investigations Center, which has access to a variety of tools to facilitate Internet investigations. ATF also enforces firearm laws through regulatory inspections of licensed firearms dealers.

This report examines (1) the status of ESF assistance and projects provided to the West Bank and Gaza for fiscal years 2015 and 2016, including payments to PA creditors, and (2) the extent to which USAID conducted required vetting of PA creditors to ensure that assistance would not support entities or individuals associated with terrorism and assessed PA ministries' capacity to use ESF assistance as intended. GAO reviewed appropriations legislation, related budget justification documents, and financial data for fiscal years 2015 and 2016, including expenditures as of March 31, 2018, provided by USAID's West Bank and Gaza mission in Tel Aviv, Israel. GAO also reviewed relevant USAID policies and procedures and interviewed USAID officials in Washington, D.C., and Tel Aviv. What GAO Found As of March 31, 2018, the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) had obligated about $544.1 million (over 99 percent) and expended about $350.6 million (over 64 percent) of approximately $544.5 million in ESF assistance allocated for the West Bank and Gaza in fiscal years 2015 and 2016. USAID obligated portions of the allocated funds for direct payments to Palestinian creditors\u2014specifically, payments to two Israeli fuel companies, to cover debts for petroleum purchases, and",
    "gao_GAO-18-600": "Why GAO Did This Study The Coast Guard is responsible for carrying out the nation's polar icebreaking missions. In June 2013, the Coast Guard established the HPIB program to acquire three heavy polar icebreakers and three medium polar icebreakers. The IPO is responsible for managing and overseeing the HPIB program. GAO was asked to review the HPIB program. This report examines (1) the extent to which the HPIB program has taken steps to develop mature designs and technologies consistent with best practices, (2) the extent to which the HPIB program has taken steps to set realistic cost and schedule estimates, and (3) the status of the HPIB program's contracting efforts and funding considerations. GAO reviewed program documents and interviewed officials from the Coast Guard, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), and the Navy. What GAO Found The Coast Guard set the HPIB's acquisition program baselines without conducting a preliminary design review to assess the design maturity of the ship or a technology readiness assessment to determine the maturity of key technologies. This approach meets DHS acquisition policy requirements but is contrary to GAO best practices. The Coast Guard intends on using what it refers to as proven technologies for the HPIB but has not conducted a technology readiness assessment to determine the maturity of key technologies that drive performance of the ship prior to completing the HPIB's preliminary design review. The Coast Guard intends on using what it refers to as proven technologies for the HPIB but has not conducted a technology readiness assessment to determine the maturity of key technologies that drive performance of the ship prior to completing the preliminary design review. The Coast Guard also intends on using what it has deemed \"state-of-the-market\" or \"proven\" technologies for the HPIB. However, the program's planned level of maturity for the ship's technologies falls short of GAO best practices. Without a technology readiness assessment, the Coast Guard does not have full insight into whether the technologies are mature, potentially underrepresenting technical risk and increasing design risk. As a result, the Coast Guard will be committing resources to the HPIB program without key elements of a sound business case, increasing the risk that the program will exceed its planned costs and schedule goals. The cost estimate and schedule that informed DHS's decision to authorize the HPIB program do not reflect the full scope",
    "gao_GAO-19-155": "Why GAO Did This Study The Air Force relies on RPA pilots to fly its RPAs. The Air Force established a RPA pilot career field in 2010 to provide officers with greater leadership responsibilities. The Air Force has also promoted RPA pilots at rates that were generally similar to pilots in other career fields. GAO was asked to review the Air Force's RPA pilot workforce. This report examines the extent to which the Air Force (1) promoted RPA pilots and (2) assigned non-operational staff positions requiring RPA pilots to entities at high rates since 2013. GAO analyzed Air Force promotion data from 2013 through 2017, reviewed relevant policies and procedures, and interviewed officials from the Air Force and the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Personnel and Readiness. What GAO Found The Air Force promoted remotely piloted aircraft (RPA) pilots at rates that were generally similar to pilots in other career fields since 2013. The percentage of eligible RPA pilots promoted was generally similar in comparison to the promotion rates of pilots in other career fields since 2013. However, it is important to note that since the population of eligible RPA pilots to be considered for promotion was smaller than other pilot populations, the promotion of one or two RPA pilots could have a large effect on their promotion rate. For example, in 2014, 94 percent of eligible RPA pilots (29 of 31), bomber pilots (47 of 50), fighter pilots (189 of 201) and 91 percent of eligible mobility pilots (355 of 388) were promoted from captain to major. This is an improvement in promotion rates for RPA pilots compared to 2006 through 2012, where RPA pilot promotion rates fell below those for all other pilots in 5 of the 7 promotion boards held during that time frame. Additionally, RPA pilots were nominated to attend developmental education programs, such as professional military education, at rates similar to the rates for other pilots from academic years 2014 through 2018, according to GAO's analysis of Air Force promotion data. For the academic years 2014 through 2018, nomination rates for RPA pilots to Intermediate and Senior Developmental Education programs combined ranged from a low of 25 percent for academic year 2016 to a high of 31 percent for academic year 2015. In comparison, nomination rates across the same time period for pilots in other career fields ranged from a low of 21 percent for mobility pilots for academic year",
    "gao_GAO-18-325": "Why GAO Did This Study In 2000, VA created the VA Technology Transfer Program to facilitate the commercialization of VA inventions. Universities are to take the lead on patenting and licensing inventions, and VA can retain joint ownership of inventions. GAO was asked to review VA's technology transfer program. This report examines (1) steps VA has taken to educate researchers and universities about invention disclosure requirements and (2) how VA ensures that universities report information about commercialization activities for joint inventions. GAO reviewed VA policies and agreements with universities, and interviewed VA and university officials. GAO also reviewed 12 annual reports from universities from fiscal years 2011 through 2017, selected based on their size and number of inventions. What GAO Found The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) has taken steps to educate researchers about invention disclosure requirements but could enhance researchers' training. VA has taken steps to educate researchers about invention disclosure requirements, but VA officials reported that the researchers have not consistently disclosed inventions to VA because they did not always fully understand VA's disclosure policy. For example, in December 2016, VA officials said that once the technology transfer office began sending researchers e-mail notices about the need to disclose inventions, the number of disclosures increased, which they said suggested underreporting had been occurring. In March 2017, VA officials said that many of the inventions from more than 50 researchers during a 5-year period at one university had not been disclosed until VA checked with the university and discovered the error. By November 2017, VA technology transfer officials thought disclosure had improved throughout VA, but they were still not able to describe the extent of the problem. Researchers GAO interviewed at the six medical centers in its sample generally believed that they had properly disclosed inventions. However, according to VA officials, a university official, and two VA researchers, there could be several reasons that contributed to researchers not consistently disclosing inventions to VA, including the following: Researchers may have disclosed inventions to their university, assuming the university would disclose them to VA on their behalf. Researchers were not familiar with VA's invention disclosure process because the process was not routine to them. Researchers may have believed they did not use VA resources and did not realize they were still required to disclose to VA. VA officials said that mandatory training would be helpful. Without requiring researchers to take online training on the invention disclosure process annually, researchers may not be fully informed about the requirement to disclose inventions, which can result in lost technology transfer opportunities and lost",
    "gao_GAO-18-667T": "Why GAO Did This Study The federal government relies heavily on information technology (IT) equipment manufactured in foreign nations. Federal information and communications systems can include a multitude of IT equipment, products, and services, each of which may rely on one or more supply chains\u2014that is, the set of organizations, people, activities, information, and resources that create and move a product or service from suppliers to an organization's customers. This statement summarizes the extent to which (1) federal laws and guidelines require the establishment of information security programs and provide for managing supply chain risk; (2) federal agencies have addressed IT supply chain risks for their information systems; and (3) federal agencies have taken steps to address IT supply chain risks for their information systems. This statement is based on GAO's March 2012 report, Information Security: Federal Agencies Have Acquired to Better Address IT Supply Chain Risks for Their Information Systems (GAO-12-322). In that report, GAO made eight recommendations to the four national security-related agencies (i.e., Defense, Justice, Energy, and DHS) that addressed supply chain risks for their information systems. The three agencies generally agreed with GAO's recommendations and, subsequently, implemented seven of the eight recommendations. What GAO Found In several reports issued since 2012, GAO has pointed out that the reliance on complex, global IT supply chains introduces multiple risks to federal information and telecommunications systems. This includes the risk of these systems being manipulated or damaged by leading foreign cyber-threat nations such as Russia, China, Iran, and North Korea. Threats and vulnerabilities created by these cyber-threat nations, vendors or suppliers closely linked to cyber-threat nations, and other malicious actors can be sophisticated and difficult to detect and, thus, pose a significant risk to organizations and federal agencies. In March 2012, GAO reported that the four national security-related agencies (i.e., Defense, Justice, Energy, and DHS) had acknowledged the risks presented by supply chain vulnerabilities. However, the agencies varied in the extent to which they had addressed these risks by (1) defining supply chain protection measures for department information systems, (2) developing implementing procedures for these measures, and (3) establishing capabilities for monitoring compliance with, and the effectiveness of, such measures. Of the four agencies, the Department of Defense had made the most progress addressing the risks. Specifically, the department's supply chain risk",
    "gao_GAO-18-89": "Why GAO Did This Study Natural gas storage sites are key parts of our energy system, helping ensure that natural gas is available when demand peaks. In 2016, Congress passed and the President signed the Protecting Our Infrastructure of Pipelines and Enhancing Safety (PIPES) Act of 2016 to require the Department of Transportation (DOT) to issue minimum safety standards for natural gas storage sites. The act also directed GAO to report on the safety of natural gas storage sites. This report examines (1) the status of PHMSA's efforts to implement the requirement under the act, and (2) the extent to which PHMSA has planned strategically to enforce its safety standards for natural gas storage sites. GAO reviewed laws, regulations, and agency documents; analyzed data from PHMSA and DOE's Energy Information Administration about natural gas storage sites; and interviewed agency officials. What GAO Found To meet the requirement under the Protecting Our Infrastructure of Pipelines and Enhancing Safety (PIPES) Act of 2016, PHMSA issued an interim final rule that includes minimum safety standards based largely on industry consensus standards. The rule took effect in January 2017 and provided that existing facilities (and those constructed by July 18, 2017) must meet the standards by January 18, 2018. PHMSA is now considering public comments on its interim standards, and it plans to finalize them by January 2018. PHMSA also has stated that it will delay enforcement of certain standards in the interim final rule until 1 year after issuance of the final rule. To enforce PHMSA's safety standards, the agency's officials have taken a variety of steps to establish a safety enforcement program for natural gas storage sites, but they have not yet followed certain leading practices of strategic planning in starting PHMSA's natural gas storage program. Specifically, PHMSA officials have begun developing a training program for natural gas storage inspectors. They also have established a strategic goal and begun developing a training performance goal for their natural gas safety enforcement program. However, they have not yet followed certain leading practices for strategic planning\u2014the systematic process for defining desired outcomes and translating this vision into goals and steps to achieve them. For example, PHMSA's training performance goal does not define the level of performance officials hope to achieve or address all core program activities, such as conducting effective inspections. In addition, PHMSA has not used baseline data or budgetary information to inform the development of performance goals. PHMSA officials explained",
    "gao_GAO-18-561": "Why GAO Did This Study The Columbia River Basin is the fourth largest river basin in the United States and covers parts of seven states and British Columbia, Canada. It provides drainage for hundreds of rivers, creeks, and streams. The Basin provides environmental, economic, and social benefits to many public and private interests and is vital to many industries in the Pacific Northwest, including sport and commercial fisheries, agriculture, forestry, transportation, recreation, and electrical power generation. However, activities from these industries have affected the environment in the Basin and, among other impacts, impaired water quality in some areas to the point where human health is at risk and historic salmon and steelhead stocks are at risk or extinct. The Water Infrastructure Improvements for the Nation Act of 2016 amended the Clean Water Act by adding Section 123 on Columbia River Basin Restoration, which requires the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to establish the Columbia River Basin Restoration Program, including its associated Working Group. The act also requires the President's annual budget to include an interagency crosscut budget on federal agencies' budgets for and spending on environmental protection and restoration efforts in the Basin. GAO was asked to review water quality-related restoration efforts in the Basin. This report examines (1) restoration efforts to improve water quality in the Columbia River Basin from fiscal years 2010 through 2016, (2) approaches to collaboration that entities have used for selected efforts, and (3) the sources of funding and federal funding expenditures. GAO surveyed entities that implement restoration efforts in the Basin, reviewed relevant laws, and interviewed officials from federal agencies, state agencies, and nongovernmental entities. What GAO Found In response to a GAO survey, various entities\u2014federal and state agencies, tribes and tribal organizations, and nongovernmental entities\u2014identified a range of restoration efforts they implemented related to improving water quality in the Columbia River Basin from fiscal years 2010 through 2016. Although there have been some plans to guide certain restoration efforts for parts of the Basin, there is no overall plan to guide water quality-related restoration efforts throughout the Columbia River Basin or a requirement for a federal agency or others to develop such a plan. GAO found that entities implemented their restoration efforts under a range of authorities and programmatic missions. At the federal and state levels, many of the restoration efforts were implemented as part of programs with a broader geographic scope than the Basin. For example, many of EPA's efforts are",
    "gao_GAO-18-528": "Why GAO Did This Study Medicaid is jointly financed by the federal government and the states, with the federal government reimbursing states for a share of their expenditures for Medicaid covered services provided to eligible beneficiaries. The federal government reimburses states for a share of their expenditures for Medicaid covered services provided to eligible beneficiaries. States may provide Medicaid services under either or both a fee-for-service or managed care model. Under a fee-for-service model, states make payments directly to providers for services provided, and the federal government reimburses the state its share of spending based on these payments. Under a managed care service delivery model, states pay managed care organizations (MCOs) a capitation payment, which is a fixed periodic payment per beneficiary enrolled in an MCO. GAO was asked to review payment risks in Medicaid managed care. This report examines (1) the types of payment risks in Medicaid managed care, (2) challenges to effective program integrity oversight, and (3) CMS's efforts to address payment risks in Medicaid managed care. GAO reviewed relevant federal laws, regulations, and guidance; analyzed Medicaid audit reports and other sources; and interviewed officials from CMS, states, and MCOs. What GAO Found GAO identified six types of payment risks in Medicaid managed care, with stakeholders identifying some risks as greater than others. Four of these risks relate to the payments state Medicaid agencies make to MCOs, and two relate to payments that MCOs make to providers. In terms of the relative importance of these payment risks, two payment risks were more frequently cited by stakeholders as having a higher level of risk than other types\u2014incorrect MCO fee-for-service payments to providers and inaccurate state capitation rates. The remaining four payment risks were more frequently cited as having lower or unknown levels of risk: improper state capitation payments, state payments to noncompliant MCOs, incorrect MCO capitation payments, and duplicate state payments. GAO identified six challenges to effective program integrity oversight in Medicaid managed care based on its review of Medicaid audit reports and other sources. Among these six challenges, stakeholders most frequently cited allocation of resources, quality of data and technology, and adequacy of state policies and practices as key challenges. Some stakeholders also described strategies to address these challenges. CMS has taken important steps to address payment risks in Medicaid managed care, issuing a final rule, increasing guidance, and conducting",
    "gao_GAO-19-217": "Why GAO Did This Study OPM administers two defined-benefit retirement plans that provide retirement, disability, and survivor benefits to federal employees. OPM's retirement application processing is one of the largest and most complex processes in the federal government. OPM's retirement application processing is a complex process that involves submitting paper applications, obtaining information from payroll offices, and completing other tasks. GAO was asked to review OPM's retirement application processing. This report examines (1) the extent to which OPM's retirement application processing timeliness is attributed to paper-based applications, staffing, and missing information in applications, and (2) the extent to which OPM provides assistance to agencies on retirement applications. GAO reviewed OPM's fiscal year 2018 budget justification and interviewed OPM officials. What GAO Found The Office of Personnel Management (OPM) has experienced delays in processing federal employee retirement applications, attributed in part to paper-based applications, staffing, and missing information in applications. OPM officials reported that OPM has automated some front-end processing steps, despite various challenges, such as OPM's and agencies' legacy systems lacking functionality or integration, inaccurate data due to manual data-entry errors, and lack of real-time data because data are stored in inconsistent formats at multiple locations. OPM officials reported that hiring freezes, continuing resolutions, and other budget constraints affected hiring numbers and created hiring delays over the past 5 fiscal years. During the months of January and February in this time period, OPM received an average of about 13,200 applications per month, a considerable increase over its average of about 7,200 per month at other times of the year. Despite the increase in applications, OPM's application processing numbers remained essentially the same in January and February (8,200 per month) compared to other months of the year (8,100 per month), thus increasing OPM's inventory of unprocessed applications, which ranged from approximately 11,400 to 24,200 for the time period shown. The increase in inventory was partly mitigated in March of each year, when OPM processed an average of about 11,000 applications. OPM officials reported that they processed more applications in March because they used overtime pay and flexible staffing across work units, such as temporarily shifting staff to a different unit to expedite workflow, screened for complete applications, and received fewer applications as surge periods",
    "gao_GAO-18-88": "Why GAO Did This Study CMS is responsible for preventing and detecting fraud in Medicare and Medicaid, which are the two largest health-care programs in the United States. CMS has four principal programs: Medicare, Medicaid, CHIP, and the health-insurance marketplaces. GAO was asked to review CMS's antifraud efforts. This report examines (1) CMS's management of fraud risks in Medicare and Medicaid and (2) the extent to which CMS's efforts align with the Fraud Risk Framework. GAO reviewed CMS documents and interviewed CMS officials and stakeholders, including state officials, contractors, and others. GAO also reviewed relevant federal internal control standards and guidance. What GAO Found The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) manages fraud risks as part of its broader program-integrity approach to address fraud, waste, and abuse. CMS's antifraud efforts for its four principal programs are part of the agency's broader program-integrity approach to address fraud, waste, and abuse. CMS's antifraud control activities mainly focus on providers in Medicare fee-for-service (FFS), which is the most mature of its programs. CMS also works with an extensive and complex network of stakeholders, including state Medicaid program-integrity units, contractors, and law enforcement groups. Consistent with the Fraud Risk Framework, CMS has demonstrated commitment to combating fraud by creating a dedicated entity to lead antifraud efforts. CMS has also taken steps to establish a culture conducive to fraud risk management, although it could expand its antifraud training to include all employees. CMS has identified some fraud risks in Medicare and Medicaid, but it has not conducted a fraud risk assessment or developed a risk-based antifraud strategy for Medicare and Medicaid as defined in the Fraud Risk Framework. Such a risk assessment would provide the detailed information and insights needed to create a fraud risk profile, which, in turn, is the basis for creating an antifraud strategy. CMS has not conducted a fraud risk assessment for Medicare or Medicaid because, within its broader approach of preventing and eliminating improper payments, its focus has been on addressing specific vulnerabilities among provider groups that have shown themselves particularly prone to fraud, waste, and abuse. With this approach, it is unlikely that CMS will be able to design and implement the most-appropriate control activities to respond to the full portfolio of fraud risks. Without a fraud",

In fiscal year 2016, the Federal Reserve paid about $660 million for note production. BEP is responsible for ensuring the security of the U.S. currency market. BEP's current facility, located in Washington, D.C., is the primary production facility. BEP has been pursuing a new facility to replace the current facility. GAO was asked to review BEP's decision to pursue a new facility. This report examines (1) the factors that led BEP to determine that a new facility is the preferred alternative for its currency production process and (2) the extent to which BEP followed leading capital-planning practices and its 2017 cost estimate. GAO reviewed relevant laws, regulations, and guidance; analyzed BEP documents; and interviewed BEP, Treasury, and Federal Reserve officials. What GAO Found The Bureau of Engraving and Printing (BEP) studied alternatives, costs, potential sites, and program requirements to ensure future currency production in the District of Columbia (D.C.) area. In 2013, BEP contracted for studies to investigate alternatives, costs, potential sites, and program requirements to ensure future currency production in the D.C. area. In 2013, BEP proposed to the Secretary of the Treasury, with the support of Treasury officials, that Treasury and BEP pursue the hybrid alternative, which would require BEP to produce currency at its current location while it was being renovated. The 2013 study concluded that BEP should pursue the new build alternative because it was estimated to be the least costly option, could be completed in the shortest time frame, and promised the greatest efficiencies. The 2017 study estimated that the hybrid option would cost approximately $1.389 billion and that the renovation option would cost approximately $1.957 billion. Federal Reserve officials concur with the 2013 study that a new facility is warranted, that a renovation of the existing facility would be more costly than a new facility, and a renovation would not provide the same degree of efficiency. BEP officials said that they support a new building over a renovation because the new build would both be less expensive and have greater benefits than a renovation. However, BEP officials said that if BEP does not get the legal authority necessary to use its revolving fund to purchase land and build a new facility in 2018, BEP will pursue a renovation of the existing",

The SPR is a key component of the U.S. energy supply. The SPR is a key component of the U.S. energy supply, and it holds about 713.5 million barrels of oil. Congress has mandated that DOE purchase or sell oil to meet its mission requirements. DOE has spent $22 million as of February 2018, according to DOE officials. This testimony discusses (1) how the United States and other IEA members meet their 90-day reserve obligations and hold significant proportions of their reserves as petroleum products, and (2) DOE's plans for modernizing the SPR. This statement is based on GAO's May 2018 report, Energy Policy and Conservation: DOE Has Taken Steps to Plan for the SPR's Modernization (GAO-2018-08). GAO reviewed relevant laws, regulations, and DOE documents and interviewed agency officials. What GAO Found As of December 2017, most other International Energy Agency (IEA) members rely at least in part on private rather than public reserves to meet their obligations. As of December 2017, 18 of the 25 IEA members that met their 90-day reserve obligation and had a formal process for holding and releasing reserves relied entirely or in part on private reserves to meet their obligations. Unlike the 18 countries that rely at least in part on private reserves, as of December 2017, the United States and 6 other IEA members met the 90-day reserve obligation exclusively through public reserves. The second way other IEA members differ from the United States is that most hold at least a third of their reserves as petroleum products. Holding petroleum products can be advantageous during certain disruptions because such reserves can be directly distributed to consumers, whereas crude oil must first be refined and turned into products, adding response time. In contrast, more than 99 percent of the SPR (665.5 million barrels as of March 2018) is held as crude oil. DOE has not identified the optimal size or the potential need for additional regional product reserves for the SPR. In 2016, DOE completed a long-term strategic review of the SPR after its last comprehensive examination had been conducted in 2005.

In September 2014, the Bureau decided to use a reengineered approach for building its address list for the 2020 Census and not go door-to-door (or \"in-field\") across the country, as it has in prior decennial censuses. Rather, some areas (known as \"blocks\") would only need a review of their address and map information using computer imagery and third-party data sources\u2014what the Bureau calls \"in-office\" address canvassing procedures. GAO was asked to review the Bureau's address canvassing operation. This report examines (1) the extent to which the Bureau followed procedures for address canvassing and (2) the extent to which the Bureau has documented procedures for managing address canvassing operations. GAO reviewed Bureau documents and interviewed Bureau officials. GAO also observed three in-field address canvassing operations at three test sites. What GAO Found The U.S. Census Bureau (Bureau) completed in-field address canvassing as scheduled by September 29, 2017, canvassing approximately 340,400 addresses. Most of the listers GAO observed generally followed procedures. For example, 15 of 18 listers knocked on doors, and 16 of 18 looked for hidden housing units, which is important for establishing that address lists and maps are accurate and for identifying hard-to-count populations. However, the Bureau experienced some issues reassigning work, estimating workload and lister productivity, and managing to staffing goals.

FDA has a variety of incentives for orphan drugs, including a tax credit that allows drug manufacturers to charge higher prices for orphan drugs. GAO was asked to review FDA's orphan drug program. This report examines (1) steps FDA has taken to address the demand for orphan designations, and (2) the extent to which FDA's orphan drug marketing approvals are consistent with its criteria. GAO reviewed FDA data on orphan designation applications received from 2008 to 2017, reviewed 148 OOPD review templates, and interviewed FDA officials and stakeholders. What GAO Found The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has implemented a number of steps under its Orphan Drug Modernization Plan to address the demand for orphan designations, and has recently met its timeliness goals. In June 2017, FDA issued its Orphan Drug Modernization Plan and has implemented a number of steps under the plan to address the demand for orphan designations. According to OOPD data, the number of new designation applications received grew from 185 in 2008 to 527 in 2017 (an increase of 185 percent), while the number of designations granted also grew during the same period. To accomplish its first goal, the modernization plan outlined seven actions FDA planned to take to temporarily increase OOPD resources for reviewing designation applications. For example, the agency established an experienced team of senior OOPD reviewers to focus solely on the backlog of designation applications. In addition, OOPD initially enlisted temporary assistance from the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research (CBER) and the Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER) reviewers who expressed interest in helping clear the backlog. As a result of these efforts, FDA cleared the application backlog by August 28, 2017, nearly a month ahead of its goal. FDA generally applies consistent criteria in reviewing applications for orphan designation, but did not ensure that all required information was consistently recorded in its review templates and evaluated when making designation decisions. For example, 102 of 148 review templates were missing one or more elements of the regulatory history of a drug, and 19 of 148 review templates did not capture all prior orphan designations for the drug and disease.

    "gao_GAO-18-397T": "Why GAO Did This Study The U.S. Border Patrol is responsible for securing the southwest border, which includes the San Diego and Rio Grande Valley sectors. The Border Patrol has invested over $2.4 billion in tactical infrastructure, such as fencing, and has also faced challenges in maintaining this infrastructure. In January 2017, the Border Patrol issued an executive order that called for the hiring of 5,000 additional Border Patrol agents, subject to available appropriations. This statement discusses (1) the status of CBP's efforts to deploy surveillance technology along the southwest border and assess the contributions of surveillance technologies to border security operations, and (2) the extent to which CBP has assessed the impact of existing fencing on border security operations. This statement is based on GAO products issued from February 2011 through November 2017, selected updates conducted in March 2018, and ongoing work. GAO reviewed relevant documents and interviewed officials from DHS, the Border Patrol, and other organizations. What GAO Found The Department of Homeland Security's (DHS) Customs and Border Protection (CBP) has made progress deploying surveillance technology along the southwest border, but has not fully assessed its effectiveness. In November 2017, GAO reported on the progress the Border Patrol had made deploying technology along the southwest border in accordance with its 2011 Arizona Technology Plan and 2014 Southwest Border Technology Plan. For example, according to officials, the Border Patrol had completed deployments of all planned Remote Video Surveillance Systems (RVSS), Mobile Surveillance Capability systems, and Unattended Ground Sensors, as well as 15 of 53 Integrated Fixed Tower systems to Arizona. In addition, the Border Patrol had efforts underway to deploy other technology programs, but at the time of GAO's report, some of those programs had not yet begun deployment or were not yet under contract. For example, in November 2011, GAO reported that CBP did not have the information needed to fully support and implement the Arizona Technology Plan and recommended that CBP (1) determine the mission benefits to be derived from implementation of the Arizona Technology Plan and (2) develop and apply key attributes for metrics to assess program implementation. CBP concurred with GAO's recommendations and has implemented one of them. Specifically, in March 2014, GAO reported that CBP had identified mission benefits of its surveillance technologies to be deployed along the southwest border, such as improved situational awareness and agent safety. However, the agency had not developed key attributes for performance metrics for all surveillance technologies to be deployed.",
    "gao_GAO-18-21": "Why GAO Did This Study Duty-free stores are regulated by U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) and the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and are a key component of the U.S. tobacco industry. Duty-free stores are also regulated by the Department of Justice and the Department of the Treasury. U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) and ICE are responsible for enforcing U.S. laws and regulations related to duty-free cigarette exports. GAO was asked to review duty-free cigarette exports. This report examines (1) requirements that govern the lawful sale and export of cigarettes from duty-free stores on the southwest border and schemes for illicit trade in such cigarettes that agencies identified, (2) U.S. agency observations about these duty-free cigarette exports and efforts to counter illicit trade, and (3) the extent to which selected cigarette transaction data submitted by duty-free stores indicate compliance issues with reporting requirements. GAO reviewed relevant laws and regulations; analyzed export data from 2010 through 2015 from CBP and ICE; and interviewed U.S. and Mexican officials. What GAO Found U.S. regulations require duty-free stores to have procedures to provide reasonable assurance that duty-free merchandise sold will be exported and requires the exporter to report information on the export of commercial cargo, which CBP considers to be transactions valued at more than $2,500. Census data indicate that about 18,500 such transactions occurred from 2010 through 2015 at duty-free stores on the southwest border. According to information from CBP and a Mexican customs official, Mexican requirements dictate that, depending on place of residence, some adult travelers to Mexico can bring in one carton of cigarettes tax-exempt, and some residents can bring in an additional three cartons if they pay taxes on them. Bringing in any quantity above four cartons would require an individual to register as an importer with the Mexican government, according to the same Mexican official. U.S. agencies identified three schemes used to evade cigarette-related taxes and other legal requirements in the United States and Mexico: (1) diverting cigarettes from the store directly into U.S. commerce; (2) smuggling duty-free cigarettes into Mexico through U.S. ports of entry by concealing them, while potentially also bribing Mexican customs officials to evade payment of Mexican taxes; and (3)",

FNS is responsible for authorizing and monitoring stores from which recipients may purchase food. FNS also is responsible for preventing and responding to retailer trafficking\u2014one type of program fraud. GAO was asked to review FNS's efforts to prevent and respond to retailer trafficking. This report examines (1) the extent to which FNS's estimates of retailer trafficking are reliable, (2) steps FNS has taken to prevent, detect, and respond to retailer trafficking, and (3) the extent to which FNS has established performance measures to assess its retailer trafficking prevention activities. GAO analyzed FNS data on retailer trafficking from fiscal years 2006 through 2014, reviewed FNS policies and procedures, and interviewed FNS officials. What GAO Found The U.S. Department of Agriculture's (USDA) Food and Nutrition Service (FNS) estimates that approximately $330 million in Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) benefits were trafficked annually from 2006 through 2008, and that approximately 8.2 percent of all authorized stores engaged in trafficking. FNS's data indicate an increase in the estimated rate of retailer trafficking in recent years. FNS reported in March 2011 that approximately $330 million in SNAP benefits were trafficked annually from 2006 through 2008, and that approximately 8.2 percent of all authorized stores engaged in trafficking. In its most recent report from September 2017, FNS reported that approximately $1 billion in SNAP benefits were trafficked annually from 2012 through 2014, and that approximately 11.8 percent of all authorized stores engaged in trafficking. FNS has acknowledged limitations with its current approach to estimating retailer trafficking and evaluated ways to address some of those limitations. For example, FNS has not evaluated whether factors used to identify stores for possible investigation could help address the bias in its sample and improve the trafficking estimates. Without evaluating the usefulness of these factors, FNS may miss an opportunity to reduce the bias in the sample and improve the trafficking estimates. FNS has taken some steps to prevent retailer trafficking that align with leading fraud risk management practices and GAO's prior recommendations, but has not pursued some opportunities for early oversight. For example, FNS has taken steps to increase food stock requirements and assess retailer risk levels. However, FNS is not using this information to target",

GAO was asked to review RFA. This report examines (1) the extent to which RFA requirements apply to recent rules and the extent to which regulators have analyzed the impact of RFA requirements on small entities and (2) the extent to which regulators have policies and procedures for RFA compliance. GAO reviewed RFA requirements and regulations, reviewed regulators' certifications and regulatory flexibility analyses, and interviewed agency officials. GAO also reviewed relevant federal guidance and regulations. What GAO Found The Financial Regulators Act of 1980 (RFA) requires that agencies analyze the impact of proposed and final rules on small entities and, when there may be a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities, to consider any significant regulatory alternatives that will achieve statutory objectives while minimizing any significant economic impact on small entities. GAO found that the regulators did not publish a proposed rule for most of the rules GAO reviewed. The regulators also did not perform regulatory flexibility analyses in most of the rules GAO reviewed. For the 316 rules subject to RFA requirements from 2010 through 2016, regulators certified that most would not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. The regulators certified that most of the rules would not have a significant impact on a substantial number of small entities. The Federal Reserve, the Securities and Exchange Commission, and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) performed some RFA analyses in these rules, although such analyses were not required. The Federal Reserve most frequently performed some RFA analyses in these rules, although such analyses were not required. For the 18 certifications in which regulators determined rules would have some economic impact on small entities, they conducted additional analyses to determine that the impact was not significant for a substantial number of small entities. The regulators' guidance for complying with RFA generally does not include policies and procedures for helping ensure consistent and complete regulatory flexibility analyses.

The National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2013 required the Air Force to conduct a study to determine whether, and how, the Air Force structure should be modified to best fulfill mission requirements in a manner consistent with available resources. The act also required the Air Force to report on the status of its HH-60Gs. The act also required the Air Force to report on the status of its HH-60Gs. This report examines the extent to which the Air Force has (1) experienced declines in the material condition of its HH-60Gs and maintenance challenges, and (2) identified potential training challenges. GAO reviewed Air Force maintenance data and Air Force contract documents and interviewed Air Force officials. What GAO Found The material condition of the Air Force's HH-60Gs has declined and maintenance challenges have increased, in part due to extensions beyond the initially designed service life of the helicopters. In November 2017, the Air Force's HH-60Gs were about 5 percent below their desired \u201cmission capable\u201d rate of 75 percent, which refers to the material condition of a squadron's possessed aircraft and their abilities to conduct their designed missions. For each of the past 5 years, the helicopters' mission capable rates have been below the Air Force's goal, and for fiscal year 2017, 68 percent of the 96 helicopter fleet were mission capable. According to Air Force officials, the HH-60Gs were initially designed to have a service life of approximately 6,000 flight hours. However, in May 2018, the fleet-wide average was approximately 7,100 flight hours, or about 18 percent more than their initial expected service life. Air Force officials told GAO that the Combat Rescue Helicopter fielding schedule, which was included in the contract for the new helicopters, was designed to ensure that helicopters with the highest flying hours are generally replaced first. The officials told GAO that this is why the active component units, which have higher flying-hour averages, would begin receiving their new Combat Rescue Helicopters in fiscal year 2020. The Air Force has identified potential training challenges, but would likely incur costs if it adjusted the fielding schedule for its Combat Rescue Helicopters.

The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA) permitted states to expand Medicaid eligibility to a new population\u2014non- elderly, non-pregnant adults who are not eligible for Medicare and whose income does not exceed 138 percent of the federal poverty level (FPL). This expansion population comprised 20 percent of total Medicaid enrollment in 2017. GAO was asked to review the expansion of Medicaid. This report describes national survey estimates of (1) the number and demographic characteristics of uninsured, low-income adults in expansion and non-expansion states; (2) unmet medical needs for low-income adults in expansion and non-expansion states and by insurance status; (3) barriers to health care for low-income adults in expansion and non-expansion states and by insurance status; and (4) having a usual place of care and receiving selected health care services for low-income adults in expansion and non-expansion states and by insurance status. GAO analyzed 2016 National Health Interview Survey (NHIS) data from the 2016 National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS), which is a federal agency within the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). GAO also interviewed NCHS officials and reviewed relevant documents. GAO also interviewed a nongeneralizable sample of NHIS respondents in three states selected based on their state of residence. What GAO Found According to the 2016 National Health Interview Survey (NHIS), 5.6 million low-income adults were uninsured in 2016. Of these 5.6 million, an estimated 1.9 million uninsured, low-income adults resided in expansion states, compared with an estimated 3.7 million in non-expansion states. Estimates of uninsured, low-income adults comprised less than 1 percent of the total population for all expansion states and 3 percent of the total population for all non-expansion states. Estimates of uninsured, low-income adults in expansion states and non-expansion states showed that smaller percentages of low-income adults in expansion states reported having any unmet medical needs compared with those in non-expansion states; and smaller percentages of those who were insured reported having any unmet medical needs compared with those who were uninsure",

The MMPA generally prohibits the taking of marine mammals by U.S. citizens engaging in a specified activity, other than commercial fishing, within a specified geographic region. BOEM, NMFS, and FWS review applications for seismic surveys in each of these OCS regions. GAO was asked to review the processes BOEM, NMFS, and FWS use to review seismic survey permit applications and related incidental take authorizations. This report examines (1) BOEM's process for reviewing seismic survey permit applications in each OCS region, the number of applications reviewed from 2011 through 2016, and BOEM's review time frames; (2) NMFS's and FWS's processes for reviewing incidental-take authorization applications related to seismic surveys in each OCS region, the number of such applications reviewed by the agencies from 2011 through 2016, and their review time frames; and (3) the status of pending seismic survey permit applications and related incidental take authorizations in the Atlantic OCS region. GAO reviewed relevant laws and regulations, analyzed agency data, and interviewed agency officials and industry stakeholders. What GAO Found The Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (BOEM) has a documented process for reviewing seismic survey applications in each of the three selected OCS regions that differs at the final step. For the Alaska and Atlantic regions, applicants generally submit an application to BOEM for a seismic survey permit at the same time that they submit an application to NMFS or FWS for an incidental take authorization. For the Gulf of Mexico region, BOEM generally issues permits without requiring incidental take authorizations to be in place. Stakeholders from industry groups and BOEM officials GAO interviewed stated that differences in the review process were the natural result of the process adapting to the three selected OCS regions and their history of oil and gas exploration. For example, in the Atlantic region, there was a large vocal public opposition to the seismic surveys proposed. By contrast, according to industry stakeholders, the Gulf of Mexico region has a long history of offshore energy development and seismic survey activity. BOEM has issued permits in the Gulf of Mexico region without requiring an applicant to already have an incidental take authorization in place. Stakeholders from industry groups",

GAO was asked to review the Navy's real property. This report (1) determines the extent to which the Navy had internal control deficiencies, if any, that may impair its ability to assert that its buildings, as reported in its financial statements, exist and that the information about the buildings is complete and adequately supported by property records and (2) identifies the challenges, if any, that the Navy faces in valuing its buildings in accordance with federal accounting standards. GAO reviewed relevant documentation and interviewed cognizant officials. GAO also conducted site visits to two geographic areas and selected a nongeneralizable sample of 39 buildings for test. What GAO Found GAO identified internal control deficiencies that impaired the Navy's ability to assert that as of September 30, 2016, (1) buildings recorded in the Navy's accountable real property system and reported as assets in its financial statements existed and (2) all of the Navy's buildings were recorded in iNFADS and correctly reported as assets in Navy's financial statements. These deficiencies contributed to the Navy (1) continuing to maintain records in iNFADS for buildings that had been demolished, sometimes many years ago, and including these buildings as assets in its financial statements; (2) excluding some of the buildings that it owns from being recorded in iNFADS and reporting as assets in its financial statements; (3) erroneously reporting nonfunctional buildings as assets in its financial statements; and (4) excluding certain buildings from being reported as assets in its financial statements that met or exceeded DOD's capitalization threshold.

The Bureau's latest cost estimate, announced in October 2017, reflects the same design, but at an expected cost of $15.6 billion. GAO was asked to review the Bureau's life-cycle cost estimate. This report evaluates the reliability of the Bureau's life-cycle cost estimate. GAO analyzed the Bureau's cost estimation guidance and interviewed Bureau officials. GAO also compared the 2015 and 2017 cost estimates to describe key drivers of cost growth. What GAO Found The U.S. Census Bureau (Bureau) has made progress in developing its life-cycle cost estimate for the 2020 Census, but it has not taken all the steps needed to ensure the reliability of the estimate. GAO's Cost Estimating and Assessment Guide describes best practices for developing reliable cost estimates. For this report, GAO analyzed the Bureau's cost estimation guidance against these best practices and compared the 2015 and 2017 estimates to describe key drivers of cost growth. GAO also analyzed cost information from the Bureau and interviewed Bureau officials. The Bureau generally agreed with GAO's findings regarding the improvements the Bureau has made in its cost estimates. However, Commerce did not agree with GAO's assessment that the Bureau's 2017 life-cycle cost estimate is \"not reliable.\" Commerce noted that it had conducted two independent cost analyses and was satisfied that the cost estimate was reliable. The Bureau agreed with the overall theme of the report but did not comment on the recommendation. Consequently, an unreliable life-cycle cost estimate is one of the reasons GAO designated the 2020 Census a GAO High-Risk Area in 2017. Since GAO's June 2016 report, in which GAO reviewed the Bureau's 2015 version of the cost estimate, the Bureau has made significant progress. For example, the Bureau has put into place a work breakdown structure (WBS) that defines the work, products, activities, and resources necessary to accomplish the 2020 Census and is standardized for use in budget planning, operational planning, and cost estimation. However, the Bureau's October 2017 cost estimate for the 2020 Census does not fully reflect characteristics of a high-quality estimate as described in GAO's Cost Estimating and Assessment Guide and cannot be considered reliable.

IRS's Whistleblower Office, which is responsible for determining whistleblower awards, is responsible for collecting and using whistleblower information to determine whether taxpayers are in compliance with FBAR reporting requirements. In February 2018, IRS changed its whistleblower award policy to include FBAR penalties in whistleblower awards. GAO was asked to review IRS's whistleblower program. This report (1) describes the extent to which IRS's Whistleblower Office included FBAR penalties in whistleblower awards prior to the statutory change; (2) examines how IRS used whistleblower information on FBAR noncompliance and how IRS responded to the statutory change in definition of proceeds; (3) describes the purposes for which IRS collects and uses data from the FBAR Database and assesses the controls for ensuring data reliability; and (4) summarizes what is known about the potential effect exclusions from collected proceeds, including FBAR penalties, may have on whistleblowers bringing claims to IRS. GAO reviewed IRS documents and interviewed IRS officials and attorneys from nine law firms about their experiences representing whistleblowers who submitted allegations of FBAR noncompliance to IRS. What GAO Found The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) Whistleblower Office (WHOS) assessed approximately $10.7 million in Foreign Bank and Financial Accounts (FBAR) penalties to taxpayers who were identified in a sample of whistleblower claims. GAO reviewed 92 whistleblower claims closed between January 1, 2012, and July 24, 2017, where the identified taxpayer was also subject to an IRS FBAR examination. IRS assessed FBAR penalties in 28 of these 92 cases. In none of these instances was the FBAR penalty included in the collected proceeds used to calculate whistleblower awards. GAO's analysis of these 28 claims suggests that if IRS had included FBAR penalties in the awards, the whistleblowers involved could have received an additional $1.6 million to $3.2 million, assuming an award of between 15 and 30 percent. IRS used FBAR information from whistleblower claims for enforcement efforts, but the February 9, 2018 legislative change in the definition of proceeds increased the importance of reporting full information.

The CFATS Act of 2014 included a provision for GAO to review the CFATS program. This report examines the extent to which DHS has (1) strengthened its processes for identifying high-risk chemical facilities and (2) implemented changes to the CFATS program since GAO last evaluated it in 2013. GAO reviewed DHS regulations, guidance, and other documents and interviewed DHS officials and representatives from 11 industry associations that represent high-risk facilities and considered high-risk. What GAO Found The Department of Homeland Security's (DHS) Infrastructure Security Compliance Division (ISCD) has taken action to strengthen its processes for identifying high-risk chemical facilities. In July 2015, GAO found that ISCD used self-reported and unverified data to determine the risk categorization for facilities that held toxic chemicals that could threaten surrounding communities if released. In response to GAO's prior recommendations, ISCD implemented an updated Top-Screen survey in October 2016 and now collects data from facilities and conducts more accurate modeling to determine the actual area of impact (formerly called the Distance of Concern). In April 2018, ISCD officials reported that all of these facilities have since been reassessed using updated Top-Screen information and, where appropriate, assigned a risk tier. ISCD has nearly completed applying its revised risk assessment methodology to high-risk chemical facilities. ISCD has conducted an increased number of compliance inspections and continues to make changes to improve the efficiency of the inspection process. For the 2,466 high-risk facilities with an approved site security plan as of May 2018, ISCD had conducted 3,553 compliance inspections. ISCD officials project they will conduct fewer compliance inspections in fiscal year 2018 than in fiscal year 2017 due to two reasons. First, ISCD officials stated the program made progress resolving the backlog of facilities that required compliance inspections in fiscal years 2016 and 2017. Second, ISCD officials stated that the program's revised risk assessment approach and continued outreach efforts have resulted in an increase in the number of identified facilities with chemicals of interest.

This report examines (1) FDA's efforts to evaluate and respond to business concerns regarding the produce rule and (2) FDA's efforts to evaluate and respond to business concerns regarding the produce rule. GAO reviewed FDA documents and interviewed FDA officials and representatives from produce industry associations, a farming organization, and four organizations working with FDA to implement the produce rule. GAO also reviewed FDA data on the number of questions submitted to the TAN since GAO last reported on the rule in November 2016. What GAO Found Since GAO last reported on the produce rule in November 2016, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has continued to use its information clearinghouse, the TAN, to evaluate and respond to questions and concerns from businesses and other stakeholders regarding the produce rule. FDA received 2,665 additional questions submitted to the TAN from September 4, 2016, through June 30, 2017, of which 230 questions (about 9 percent) pertained to the produce rule. Of those 2,665 additional questions, 154 questions (about 67 percent) came from individuals who self-identified as belonging to \"business/industry.\" FDA officials said they track questions submitted to the TAN to inform the development of resources to help businesses comply with the rule. FDA has also taken other steps, including funding training for industry, conducting visits to farms, and publishing guidance, to evaluate and respond to concerns. In addition, FDA is reviewing the produce rule agricultural water standards and in September 2017, published a proposed rule to extend compliance dates associated with those standards. FDA officials GAO interviewed said their decision to review the water standards and extend compliance dates was in response to industry concerns. FDA officials said they learned about these concerns through some of the steps they have taken, which GAO identified in this report.

The act also requires agencies to report annually to Justice on their use of statutory (b)(3) exemptions. GAO was asked to review agencies' implementation of FOIA. This report examines (1) the extent to which selected agencies have implemented selected FOIA requirements; (2) the methods established by agencies to reduce backlogged requests and the effectiveness of those methods; (3) any statutory (b)(3) exemptions that have been used by agencies as the basis for withholding (redacting) information; and (4) what FOIA requests, if any, agencies received and processed that related to entities that received government assistance during the 2008 financial crisis. GAO selected 18 agencies based on the number of FOIA requests received, the size of FOIA backlogs, and the average time of processing FOIA requests for fiscal years 2012 through 2016. GAO also reviewed relevant laws, guidance, and reports and interviewed officials from Justice, the Office of Information Policy (OIP), and the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA). What GAO Found The 18 agencies GAO selected for its review had implemented the majority of the six key Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requirements. Specifically, 18 agencies updated response letters, 16 agencies implemented tracking systems, and 5 agencies published their updated FOIA regulations by the required due date. Further, most agencies designated a chief FOIA officer who is senior officials at the assistant secretary or equivalent level. The 18 agencies that GAO selected for its review had FOIA request backlogs of varying sizes, ranging from no backlogged requests at some agencies to 45,000 or more of requests at other agencies. Generally, the agencies with the largest backlogs had received the most requests. In an effort to aid agencies in reducing their backlogs, Justice's Office of Information Policy identified key practices that agencies can use. However, few of the agencies managed to reduce their backlogs during the period from fiscal year 2012 through 2016. In particular, of the four agencies with the largest backlogs, only one\u2014the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA)\u2014reduced its backlog.

DHS leadership has taken positive steps in recent years by strengthening its policies for acquisition management and resource allocation, and establishing policies related to requirements. GAO was asked to review DHS's acquisition portfolio. This report examines (1) the extent to which DHS's acquisition management policies and processes are consistent with key portfolio management practices and (2) the extent to which DHS's policies and processes are consistent with key portfolio management practices. GAO reviewed DHS policies and processes and interviewed DHS officials. GAO also reviewed 24 programs that were on track to meet schedule and cost goals during 2017. What GAO Found Of the 24 programs GAO assessed with department-approved acquisition program baselines (APB), 10 were on track to meet their schedule and cost goals during 2017. The other 14 programs were not on track because they changed or breached their schedule goals, cost goals, or both. GAO found that most programs updated their cost estimates in response to requirements DHS established in January 2016 that are intended to provide decision makers with more timely information. These actions are in accordance with GAO's best practice to regularly update cost estimates and plan to use these updated estimates to measure programs' cost changes going forward. DHS has taken steps to enhance its cost reporting while some programs still face funding gaps. For example, DHS required major acquisition programs to begin submitting to headquarters (1) detailed data on program affordability, such as updates to the program's life-cycle cost estimate and funding source information, to help inform the department's annual resource allocation process, and (2) an annual LCCE update. However, DHS no longer reported operations and maintenance (O&M) funding for individual programs. DHS officials stated that they plan to re-introduce O&M funding for major acquisition programs in the FYHSP report for fiscal years 2019\u20132023 based on multiple internal discussions about the best way to present a more comprehensive view of programs' total costs and feedback from key stakeholders, such as the Office of Management and Budget.

GAO reviewed relevant documentation and interviewed NASA officials. GAO also reviewed a generalizable sample of contracts awarded in fiscal year 2016 to determine the extent to which NASA communicated whistleblower protections to its contractors and their employees. What GAO Found From 2008 to June 2017, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration's (NASA) Office of Inspector General (OIG) investigated whistleblower reprisal complaints within required time frames. OIG received 277 whistleblower disclosures leading to 48 reprisal complaints from 2008 through June 2017, and handled those complaints within required time frames. For the 6 of those reprisal complaints that were investigated, the OIG used extensions. OIG officials said that extensions may be necessary for a number of reasons, including that the complaint may be highly technical in nature, requiring the OIG to find subject matter expertise to better understand the nature of the whistleblower complaint and whether it constitutes gross fraud, waste, abuse, or mismanagement. The OIG updated its investigation guidance in October 2017 to include subgrantee employees. The Administrator of NASA did not meet the required review time frame and issue an order of final determination of reprisal for 5 completed investigations received from the OIG from 2008 through June 2017. In all 5 cases, the Administrator took longer than the 30 days to issue an order. In one of those 5 complaints, an official from the Office of General Counsel was unable to provide GAO with the issued order and said he did not believe one was completed, and could not provide an explanation as to why an order was not completed. Despite acknowledging these challenges, the Administrator does not have a formal process or criteria to monitor and evaluate the way the office handles issuing an order of final determination to ensure that it meets the statutory time requirements.

    "gao_GAO-18-692T": "Why GAO Did This Study PTC is a federal law that requires railroads to implement PTC systems by December 31, 2020. FRA is responsible for overseeing railroads' implementation of PTC and providing technical assistance to railroads. In anticipation of the upcoming implementation deadline, FRA began to send notification letters to railroads it determined were at risk of both not meeting the end of 2018 implementation deadline and not completing the requirements necessary to qualify for an extension. This testimony discusses (1) the status of PTC implementation and FRA's efforts to ensure railroads are in compliance with PTC deadlines, and (2) the extent to which FRA is ensuring that railroads are in compliance with PTC deadlines. This statement is based on GAO's body of work on PTC implementation and FRA's oversight of implementation. GAO reviewed FRA documents and interviewed FRA officials and representatives from 40 railroads implementing PTC, including Amtrak, commuter, and Class I railroads. What GAO Found As of June 30, 2018, many railroads reported that they remain in the equipment installation and field-testing stages, which are early stages of PTC implementation. However, since GAO last testified in March 2018, railroads have made progress on equipment installation. Specifically, three-quarters of the 40 railroads reported being more than 90 percent complete with locomotive equipment installation. Similarly, nearly three-quarters of railroads that must install wayside equipment reported being more than 90 percent complete. The remaining one-quarter of railroads are among those designated by FRA as at-risk of both not meeting the end of 2018 implementation deadline and not completing the requirements necessary to qualify for an extension. Specifically, in August 2018, FRA identified 9 railroads\u2014all commuter railroads\u2014as at-risk, fewer than the 12 railroads FRA had previously designated as at risk in its June 2018 letters to railroads. Most commuter railroads reported slow progress with testing, especially with revenue service demonstration (RSD), while Class I railroads and Amtrak have reached later stages of testing. For example, 19 of 28 commuter railroads reported having initiated this testing as of June 30, 2018, 6 more commuter railroads than the 13 GAO previously reported as having initiated field testing as of September 30, 2017. Additionally, 8 of 28 commuter railroads reported initiating RSD testing as of June 30, 2018, 2 more commuter railroad",

FDA is required to use the least burdensome approach to ensure that medical device sponsors provide reasonable assurance of safety and effectiveness. FDAMA also requires FDA to conduct an independent evaluation of its medical device review process. GAO was asked to review FDA's implementation of the least burdensome requirements. This report examines (1) FDA's implementation of the least burdensome requirements and (2) FDA's efforts to evaluate its implementation of the least burdensome requirements. GAO reviewed FDA guidance and FDA data on the least burdensome requirements and interviewed FDA officials and industry representatives. GAO also reviewed FDA's evaluation of its medical device review process. What GAO Found The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) frequently requested additional information to support medical device reviews, and sponsor disagreements often related to least burdensome requirements. FDA issued a large number of deficiency letters and additional information letters for a majority of the medical device reviews it reviewed from 2001 through 2016. FDA officials acknowledged the historical increase in the number of deficiency letters and AI letters and noted the more recent decrease. FDA officials attributed this decrease to a number of changes FDA agreed to in the Medical Device User Fee Amendments of 1997 (MDUFA) and a number of changes FDA agreed to in MDUFA III. FDA officials also noted that the least burdensome requirements were often a significant contributing factor in disagreements raised by medical device sponsors. FDA officials indicated that training specific to the least burdensome requirements was held in the years following the enactment of FDAMA in 1997. FDA officials told GAO that the training was specific to the least burdensome requirements and offered from 1997 through 1999. FDA officials also identified the training program for new reviewers that FDA implemented in 2011 as a source of training on the least burdensome requirements. FDA is implementing such processes for all training, including courses related to the least burdensome requirements.

In response to a congressional request, GAO reviewed U.S. counternarcotics efforts in Colombia, focusing on: (1) U.S. agencies' efforts to monitor and evaluate U.S. counternarcotics efforts in Colombia; (2) the extent to which U.S.-supported alternative development programs have achieved positive outcomes in Colombia; and (3) the extent to which U.S.-supported alternative development programs have been implemented in Colombia. GAO reviewed U.S., Colombian, and United Nations (UN) documents and interviewed U.S., Colombian, and UN officials. What GAO Found U.S. agencies have conducted ongoing performance monitoring of various counternarcotics activities in Colombia, but State, the Department of Defense (DOD), the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), and the Department of Justice (DOJ) have not conducted evaluations of U.S. eradication and interdiction efforts in Colombia since 2008. U.S. agencies have conducted ongoing performance monitoring of various counternarcotics activities in Colombia, but State, DOD, DOJ, and DHS have not conducted evaluations of U.S. eradication and interdiction efforts in Colombia since 2008. State, DOD, DOJ, and DHS have not conducted any formal, systematic evaluations of U.S.-supported eradication and interdiction efforts in Colombia since 2008. State officials noted that they have not undertaken a comprehensive review of their counternarcotics approach in Colombia that considers the benefits and limitations of these efforts to determine whether the U.S. government's current combination of activities is the most effective approach to achieve U.S. goals. Without a comprehensive review of the U.S. counternarcotics approach in Colombia that considers the benefits and limitations of these efforts, the U.S. government lacks important information on how to most effectively combat drug trafficking in a changing environment in Colombia. U.S. officials and the studies and experts in GAO's literature review identified a number of factors that may limit the effectiveness of eradication as a supply reduction approach, including the strategies coca growers use to mitigate the effects of eradication and potential adverse effects it may have on Colombian citizens.

    "gao_GAO-19-176": "Why GAO Did This Study IRS is responsible for ensuring the nation's tax compliance and addressing the tax gap. IRS's HCO is responsible for coordinating and coordinating agency-wide strategic workforce planning efforts. GAO was asked to review IRS's strategic workforce planning efforts. This report assesses (1) how IRS defines its workforce needs and develops strategies for shaping its workforce; (2) the extent to which IRS identified the critical skills and competencies it will require to meet its goals, and describe its strategy to address skills gaps in its workforce; and (3) the extent to which IRS's Human Capital Office has the capacity to hire employees in hard to fill positions. GAO analyzed IRS data and documents, and interviewed IRS officials. What GAO Found The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) has scaled back strategic workforce planning activities in recent years. IRS staff within its Human Capital Office (HCO) or other dedicated program office conducted and coordinated agency-wide strategic workforce planning efforts. IRS officials told GAO that resource constraints and fewer staff with strategic workforce planning skills due to attrition since 2011 required HCO to largely abandon strategic workforce planning activities. Instead, HCO generally focused its efforts on completing HR transactions, such as retirements and benefits processing, meeting legal compliance activities, and facilitating hiring of seasonal employees. IRS officials told GAO the lack of an agency-wide strategy and HCO authority to manage and coordinate strategic workforce planning efforts put the agency at greater risk for unnecessary duplication of effort in HR activities; development of redundant and generally noninteroperable systems used to maintain human capital information; and failure to effectively identify and retain personnel with critical skills and experience across the agency. IRS has recently provided its HCO with authority to lead and coordinate agency-wide strategic workforce planning efforts. However, full implementation of an IRS initiative to conduct agency-wide strategic workforce planning has been put on hold as other activities have taken priority, and a key workforce planning system being developed by Treasury has been delayed. As a result, these efforts remain fragmented, and IRS lacks an inventory of its current workforce, has neither developed the competency and staffing requirements nor conducted agency-wide activities associated with analyzing the workforce to identify skills gaps, or developed strategies to address skills gaps. Additionally, IRS could improve reporting of its progress in addressing skills gaps. This critical information will help provide assurance that its fragmented human capital activities are well managed or that resources are being effectively allocated. High",

GAO was asked to review IRS's implementation of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. This report examines (1) IRS's performance during the 2018 filing season and (2) IRS's management structure to implement the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act and steps IRS has taken to more fully involve its human capital decision makers. GAO reviewed IRS documents and interviewed IRS officials. GAO also reviewed IRS data on the number of calls it answered and the number of taxpayers requesting in-person assistance.

However, timeliness in responding to written correspondence declined from last year. GAO's prior recommendations could help IRS better manage its correspondence performance and develop a comprehensive customer service strategy to improve its efforts. IRS's telephone, online, and in-person services generally improved during the 2018 filing season compared to prior years. However, timeliness in responding to written correspondence declined from last year. IRS officials attributed the improvements to decreased telephone call volume and sufficient staff levels to meet the demand for service. IRS officials attributed the improvements to decreased telephone call volume and sufficient staff levels to meet the demand for service.

The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (Corps) is responsible for regulating shellfish aquaculture activities. The Corps may authorize activities in its districts, such as seeding, rearing, and harvesting shellfish. GAO was asked to review the Corps' permitting process. This report describes, for 2012 through 2017, (1) the number and outcomes of the applications the Corps received for shellfish aquaculture activities and the types of permits the Corps used to authorize such activities, and (2) the experiences of permit applicants in selected districts in seeking Corps authorization for their shellfish aquaculture activities. GAO analyzed Corps data on applications submitted to the Corps from 2012 through 2017, reviewed relevant federal laws, regulations, and Corps documents, and interviewed Corps officials. GAO also interviewed 15 permit applicants from four Corps districts\u2014Baltimore, New Orleans, Norfolk, and Seattle\u2014based on geographic location and type of permit used to authorize shellfish aquaculture activities. What GAO Found Based on GAO's analysis of data from the Corps' permitting database, GAO found that the Corps authorized most of the 3,751 applications it received from 2012 through 2017 using various types of general and individual permits. Of the 19 Corps districts that have coastal waters within their geographic areas of responsibility, 17 Corps districts received shellfish aquaculture applications, with the Seattle District receiving the most applications and the New England District receiving the next highest amount. The number of applications does not correspond to the level of shellfish activity in a particular district, however, as some activities may be authorized under a general permit without triggering the need for an entity to submit an application for Corps authorization, as previously noted. The majority of Corps districts (13 of 17) authorized shellfish aquaculture applications using Nationwide Permit 48, which is a nationwide permit that allows entities to conduct shellfish aquaculture activities in their regions. The majority of Corps districts (13 of 17) authorized shellfish aquaculture applications using individual permits, which are generally general permits that do not require an entity to submit an application to the Corps for authorization. The majority of Corps districts (13 of 17) also authorized shellfish aquaculture applications using individual permits, but overall individual permits represented about 3 percent (85 of 3,281) of authorized activity.

The federal government supports R&D for new drugs through grants and tax incentives administered by the Internal Revenue Service. In addition, mergers and acquisitions affecting the drug industry are subject to review by the federal government to ensure compliance with applicable antitrust laws. GAO was asked to review drug industry consolidation. This report examines (1) how the financial performance and structure of the drug industry have changed over time; and (2) how reported research and development spending and new drug approvals have changed. GAO analyzed data from the Bloomberg Terminal, a publicly available source of information on drug companies, from 2006 through 2015, and reviewed relevant literature. GAO also interviewed officials from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), and the National Institutes of Health (NIH), which fund research and development (R&D), and other federal agencies. What GAO Found Among the worldwide drug companies included in the data GAO reviewed, reported pharmaceutical and biotechnology sales revenue and profit margins for most companies grew from 2006 through 2015. The number of mergers and acquisitions among companies in the industry generally held steady from 2006 through 2015, but merger and acquisition deal values increased. Market concentration varied by the specific market level considered. Industry experts GAO interviewed noted that market pressures have driven structural changes in the drug industry, such as in the types of acquisitions and increased specialization in therapeutic areas. Pharmaceutical company-reported R&D spending grew slightly from 2008 through 2014, while federally funded spending decreased slightly over the period. Industry spending focused on drug development rather than earlier-stage research, whereas direct federal spending, such as through NIH grants, funded a greater amount of basic research. Claims for the orphan drug credit, one of several federal tax incentives encouraging drug development, increased sharply from 2005 through 2014. Biologics and orphan drugs accounted for an increasing share of new drug approvals from 2005 through 2016.

    "gao_GAO-18-220": "Why GAO Did This Study Medicaid is the nation's largest health care program, with about $1.3 trillion in outlays in fiscal year 2015. CMS has long required states to conduct evaluations of their Medicaid programs, which allow them to test new approaches to coverage and to improve quality and access or generate savings or efficiencies. GAO was asked to review CMS's oversight of state-led evaluations. This report examines (1) the extent to which state-led evaluations have been useful in informing federal decision-making and (2) the extent to which CMS's evaluations have been limited by data challenges and the extent to which evaluations are publicly available. GAO reviewed CMS documents and interviewed CMS officials in Washington, D.C., and eight states selected based on the number of demonstrations in effect and cost, among other things. What GAO Found The Medicaid section 1115 demonstrations (referred to as demonstrations) in GAO's eight states varied in terms of the number of years the demonstrations had been in effect and cost, among other things. For example, three of the more mature demonstrations\u2014those in Maryland, Massachusetts, and New York\u2014had been in place for two decades. CMS has long required states to conduct evaluations of their Medicaid section 1115 demonstrations. CMS oversees the evaluations and can influence them at several key points during the demonstration process. CMS has the authority to initiate its own federal evaluations of section 1115 demonstrations, and states must fully cooperate with any such evaluations. The limitations in state-led evaluations\u2014including methodological weaknesses and gaps in results\u2014have, in part, hindered CMS's use of them to inform its policy decisions. For example, CMS had not required the states to submit final, comprehensive evaluation results at the end of each demonstration cycle. As a result, for all seven of GAO's states that had completed a demonstration cycle, CMS had received only interim evaluation reports that were generally based on more limited data from the early years of the demonstration cycle and did not include all of the analyses planned. A key contributor to the gaps in the information included in the state-led evaluations was that CMS historically had not required the states to submit final, comprehensive evaluation results at the end of each demonstration cycle. As a result, for GAO's selected states, CMS had received only interim evaluation reports that were generally based on more limited data from the early years of the demonstration cycle",

GAO has reported that the federal government is a complex and complex entity that faces a number of challenges in carrying out its mission. GAO has identified a number of areas in which the federal government could be better positioned to address its challenges. This report examines (1) key questions to assess agency reforms, (2) key practices for developing reforms, and (3) key steps in implementing reforms. GAO's prior work and leading practices are organized into four broad categories that can help the Congress assess proposed reforms. GAO's prior work and leading practices include identifying goals and outcomes, involving employees and key stakeholders, assessing areas of fragmentation, overlap, and duplication, and addressing high-risk areas and longstanding management challenges. GAO also reviewed relevant OMB guidance and interviewed OMB staff. What GAO Found Given the potential benefits and challenges developing and implementing agency reform efforts, Congress and the executive branch need the tools and information to help evaluate agencies' reform proposals and ensure they are effectively implemented. Congress's role in reviewing agency proposed reforms will be critical to the success of making significant changes in how the government operates. To assist Congress in its oversight role, GAO organized its prior work and leading practices into the following four broad categories that can help the Congress assess proposed reforms. The first is the goals and outcomes of reforms. GAO's prior work has identified useful principles, such as designing proposed reforms to achieve specific, identifiable goals that encourage decision makers to reach a shared understanding of the purpose of the reforms. The second is the process for developing reforms. Successful reforms require an integrated approach that involves employees and key stakeholders and is built on the use of data and evidence. The third is the management challenges, such as those GAO has identified as fragmented, duplicative, or overlapping, or in GAO's high-risk program, or by agency Inspectors General. The fourth is the strategic management of the federal workforce. GAO's prior work has shown that incorporating change management practices improves the likelihood of successful reforms. Moreover, it is also important to recognize agency cultural factors that can either help or inhibit reform efforts and how change management strategies may address these potential issues.

In fiscal year 2016, the program provided about $4 million in financial assistance to about 25,000 students in D.C.. GAO was asked to review DCTAG. This report examines (1) trends in eligibility for and enrollment in DCTAG and graduation rates for recipients, (2) the extent to which DCTAG communicates program performance information to key stakeholders, and (3) the design of selected scholarship programs. GAO analyzed program data and documents, and interviewed officials from OSSE, the Department of Education's Office of the State Superintendent of Education, and other organizations. What GAO Found GAO identified the following trends in eligibility for and enrollment in the District of Columbia's (D.C.) District of Columbia Tuition-Free Access Grant (DCTAG) program and graduation rates for recipients: DCTAG's potentially eligible population. ACS data for calendar years 20072016 indicate that the population of high school students with incomes within DCTAG's eligibility requirements has remained relatively stable. For academic years 20072016, about 90 percent of DCTAG recipients attended 4-year public institutions. OSSE officials told GAO they made programmatic changes to DCTAG for academic year 2018. Specifically, OSSE officials determined out-of-state-tuition at 2-year public institutions attended by DCTAG recipients exceeded in-state tuition by an average of $4,500 per year. Enrollment in DCTAG by amount awarded. For academic years 20072016, the percentage of recipients receiving DCTAG's maximum annual awards increased from 40 percent to 62 percent. OSSE officials reported that rates for recipients compare favorably to rates for national and regional groups of students with characteristics similar to those of DCTAG recipients. DCTAG partners with other entities to offer support services intended to help D.C. students prepare for college, apply for financial aid, and stay on track to graduate. These partners include OSSE's Office of College and Career Readiness, as well as partners in the broader community such as public and private high school officials and college access providers.

DOD has a process in place to recover these costs. GAO was asked to review DOD's waiver review process. This report examines (1) nonrecurring cost waivers approved by DOD from fiscal years 2012 through 2017, (2) factors DOD considers when reviewing waivers, and (3) efficiency of the waiver review process. GAO analyzed DOD data on waiver requests from fiscal years 2012 through 2017, reviewed waiver documentation, and interviewed DOD officials. What GAO Found From fiscal years 2012 through 2017, the Department of Defense (DOD) approved nonrecurring cost waivers valued at nearly $16 billion that it might otherwise have collected from foreign governments as part of its major defense equipment sales. DOD approved 810 of the 813 waiver requests it received, resulting in an approval rate of more than 99 percent. However, the dollar value of the approved waivers does not, in all instances, reflect the total amount that will ultimately be waived once sales are finalized. Rather, it reflects a ceiling for the nonrecurring costs that DOD could waive. During this time frame, DSCA collected $106 million in nonrecurring costs; however, this amount may be associated with FMS cases prior to fiscal year 2012. GAO was not able to determine the exact amount actually waived once sales agreements were finalized due to data limitations. DOD approved 99 percent of the 813 nonrecurring cost waiver requests for major defense equipment sold through the Foreign Military Sales (FMS) program. In its analysis of DSCA's data on waiver requests for the 6-year period, GAO found that DOD approved all 471 waiver requests that cited equipment standardization submitted by 25 countries and NATO, totaling approximately $6.7 billion. DOD approved all but 2 of the 340 waiver requests that cited loss of sale submitted by 34 countries, totaling almost $9.2 billion. DOD also approved a waiver of $460,000 for one of the two cost savings waiver requests it received.

In 1982, CSPF was subject to investigations by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), the Department of Labor (DOL), and the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ). In 1982, CSPF was a subject of DOL investigations and a consent decree that remains in force today. GAO was asked to review CSPF. This report examines (1) factors that contributed to CSPF's critical financial condition and (2) DOL's role in overseeing CSPF. GAO reviewed relevant federal laws, regulations, and other documents; interviewed CSPF officials and stakeholders; and reviewed relevant DOL and ERISA documents. What GAO Found The Central States, Southeast and Southwest Areas Pension Fund (CSPF) has been underfunded since the consent decree was established in 1982. CSPF's estimated funding need has not attained 100 percent of its estimated funding need since then, according to regulatory filings. CSPF's 1982 Form 5500 shows that the plan was less than 40 percent funded prior to the consent decree becoming effective. Over the next two decades, the plan generally made progress toward achieving its targeted level of funding but was never more than 75 percent funded, and funding has generally deteriorated since its 2002 filing. Stakeholders identified several factors that contributed to CSPF's critical financial condition and reflect the challenges faced by many multiemployer plans. For example, like CSPF, many multiemployer plans have experienced financial difficulties due to a combination of investment losses and insufficient employer contributions. In addition to being underfunded prior to the consent decree going into effect, stakeholders identified other specific factors that contributed to CSPF's critical financial condition, such as trends within the national trucking industry and its workforce, funding challenges and common investment practices of multiemployer plans, and the impact of market downturns on long-term investment performance. DOL has provided oversight in its role as described in the consent decree. DOL has conducted a number of investigations of CSPF in accordance with its role under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA).

The NDAA 2008 directed DOD to survey nonenrolled beneficiaries and civilian providers in at least 20 PSAs and 20 non-PSAs. The NDAA 2017 included a provision for GAO to review DOD's implementation of the NDAA 2008, as amended. This report examines (1) the extent to which nonenrolled beneficiaries and civilian providers reported experiencing problems accessing care, and (2) the extent to which nonenrolled beneficiaries and civilian providers reported awareness of TRICARE and their acceptance of new TRICARE patients. GAO analyzed DOD's 2012-2015 nonenrolled beneficiary and civilian provider surveys, interviewed DOD officials, and analyzed 190 geographic locations. What GAO Found Nationwide, a lower percentage of nonenrolled beneficiaries reported that they experienced problems finding any type of provider in the 2012-2015 survey (29 percent) compared to the prior 2008-2011 survey (31 percent). However, there was no significant statistical difference over time in the percentage of beneficiaries who reported experiencing problems finding a specialty care or mental health care provider. Nonenrolled beneficiaries' positive ratings of TRICARE have generally increased since the previous survey, and nonenrolled beneficiaries' positive ratings of their mental health care providers have generally decreased. Nonenrolled beneficiaries' positive ratings of TRICARE compared to other federal health plans, and nonenrolled beneficiaries' positive ratings of their mental health care providers were lower than those of Medicare fee-for-service beneficiaries and Medicaid beneficiaries, which is similar to what GAO found for the previous survey. Civilian providers' awareness of TRICARE has generally increased over time, while mental health providers' acceptance of new TRICARE patients has decreased. Nationwide, a higher percentage of civilian providers reported that they were aware of TRICARE in the 2012-2015 civilian provider survey (84 percent) than those from the 2008-2011 civilian provider survey (82 percent). However, awareness increased for specialty care providers (92 to 94 percent) and mental health care providers (68 to 74 percent). In addition, when GAO analyzed these results by provider type and location type, GAO found that civilian providers in both PSAs and non-PSAs reported higher awareness of TRICARE than nonnetwork providers, regardless of provider type.",

States can provide HCBS under one or more programs authorized under different sections of the Social Security Act, including several state plan and waiver authorities. States can also provide HCBS under managed care programs, which are managed by states and typically reimburse providers through capitation payments. GAO was asked to review the effectiveness of Medicaid HCBS needs assessments. This report examines (1) how selected states conducted needs assessments for HCBS programs and (2) steps CMS has taken to improve the effectiveness of HCBS needs assessments. GAO reviewed relevant federal laws, regulations, and guidance; analyzed data on HCBS needs assessments conducted by states and managed care plans; and interviewed officials from CMS and six states selected based on their Medicaid HCBS programs and delivery systems. What GAO Found The six selected states GAO reviewed used multiple tools and entities to conduct needs assessments for HCBS programs, for which both functional eligibility criteria and amount of services available to beneficiaries can differ widely. The selected states varied in the extent to which their needs assessment tools were either tailored to a single Medicaid HCBS program or used across multiple, though not necessarily all, HCBS programs in the state. The selected states also varied in the extent to which the same or different needs assessment tools were used for different purposes, such as determining functional eligibility and developing a service plan. The six selected states reported taking steps to unify their needs assessment processes and increase consistency across their distinct Medicaid HCBS programs. For example, four states reported taking steps to implement assessment tools for use across multiple Medicaid HCBS programs, while four states reported taking steps to implement new tools for specific Medicaid HCBS programs. Important benefits to beneficiaries and HCBS programs have resulted from efforts to coordinate needs assessment processes by using a uniform assessment across distinct HCBS programs. For example, officials in Minnesota reported that the uniform assessment process allowed beneficiaries to connect with the program best suited to their needs, even if they may not have otherwise been aware of it when initially seeking assistance. Selected states reported making efforts to improve their assessment processes to increase consistency in how assessors conduct HCBS needs assessments. These efforts included using structured questions and emphasizing training to ensure individual assessors approached the assessment questions consistently and according to policy.

The United States plays a significant role in both the management of peacekeeping operations and encouraging reforms to improve peacekeeping activities. GAO was asked to review UN peacekeeping operations. This report examines (1) the UN's process to establish and renew peacekeeping operations, including the tasks these operations perform; (2) the Department of State's assessment of the effectiveness of UN peacekeeping operations; (3) how the United States works within the UN to adjust peacekeeping mandates and associated resources; and (4) UN member states' concerns regarding the UN's performance information. GAO reviewed UN policy and guidance, UN budget and performance reports, and UN peacekeeping budget and performance reports. GAO also interviewed U.S. and UN officials in Washington, D.C., and four countries\u2014the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Haiti, Kosovo, and Lebanon\u2014for in-depth case studies. What GAO Found The United Nations (UN) Security Council has established and renewed peacekeeping operations, which perform a range of tasks working with UN member states. The UN Security Council has defined mandates, or tasks, for each operation, and the peacekeeping operations perform a variety of activities to fulfill these tasks. For the 11 peacekeeping operations with mandates that renew on a regular basis, State prepares strategy and priority memoranda for appropriate committees of the UN to inform the mandate renewal process. GAO's review of State's most recent assessments and discussions with State officials, GAO found that despite some military and political successes of individual peacekeeping operations, UN peacekeeping operations generally do not fully meet the U.S.-stated principles of effective peacekeeping and face challenges to achieving their mandates. For the 11 peacekeeping operations with mandates that renew on a regular basis, State prepares strategy and priority memoranda for appropriate committees of the UN to inform the mandate renewal process. State officials GAO interviewed noted the importance of UN peacekeeping operations in maintaining stability in volatile conflicts around the world. These officials noted the dangerous and hostile environments in which peacekeeping operations are located, and, in some cases, human atrocities these operations help prevent. The United States has worked with the UN to adjust peacekeeping mandates, but does not have sufficient information to determine if UN resource decisions accurately reflect these adjustments. For example, USUN officials told",

The NDAA for Fiscal Year 2017 required that DOD develop a plan to implement section 1073c of title 10, United States Code, that includes four elements: A. how the Secretary will carry out subsection (a) of section 1073c of title 10 of the United States Code; B. efforts to eliminate duplicative activities carried out by the elements of the DHA and military departments; C. efforts to maximize efficiencies in the activities carried out by the DHA; and D. how the Secretary will implement section 1073c in a manner that reduces the number of members of the armed forces, civilian employees who are full-time equivalent employees, and contractors relating to the headquarters activities of the Military Health System, as of the date of the enactment of the act. The NDAA for Fiscal Year 2019 amended section 1073c of title 10, United States Code to include a new section:  1073c Administration of Defense Health Agency and military medical treatment facilities. The NDAA for Fiscal Year 2019 also extended the date for the transfer of the administration of the MTFs to the DHA from the original deadline of October 1, 2018, to September 30, 2021. The NDAA for Fiscal Year 2019 also included a provision for GAO to review DOD's interim and final reports on the implementation plan. This report examines the extent to which DOD addressed the statutory elements in its June 2018 plan. GAO reviewed DOD's plan and supporting documents, and interviewed DOD officials. What GAO Found The Department of Defense (DOD) addressed each of the four statutory elements in its June 2018 plan. DOD dedicated most of the plan to describing the governance structure of DOD's new administrative framework and to describing the schedule for the phased transfer of the administration of approximately 457 military treatment facilities (MTF) from the military departments' respective medical commands to the Defense Health Agency (DHA). DOD's plan provided less detail on addressing efforts to eliminate duplicative activities; maximizing efficiency; and reducing the number of headquarters-level military, civilian, and contractor personnel.

VA has taken steps to dispose of these properties, including announcing a new initiative to begin the re-use or disposal process for 430 properties within 2 years. GAO was asked to review VA's disposal efforts. This report examines (1) the challenges VA faces disposing of its vacant property and how it is addressing those challenges and (2) the extent to which VA is tracking and monitoring the disposal of its properties. GAO reviewed relevant laws, regulations, policies, and other documents related to VA's real property management, including VA's guidance on managing underutilized properties and disposals. GAO also interviewed VA officials and stakeholders, including facility managers from VA's Veterans Integrated Service Networks and local facilities, who were knowledgeable about the disposal of these properties and are familiar with VA's disposal process. What GAO Found The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) has taken steps to address some of its ongoing disposal challenges, but lacks procedures to manage its properties. VA officials and stakeholders GAO spoke with said that administering both environmental and historic reviews are key challenges for disposals. Two other ongoing challenges\u2014the marketability of VA properties and prioritizing funding for disposals\u2014were also mentioned as factors impeding VA's property disposal efforts. As part of VA's initiative to begin the re-use or disposal process for 430 vacant properties within 2 years, VA has begun addressing its environmental and historic review challenges. For example, VA established a working group to assist local facilities' managers in conducting these reviews. While VA is addressing challenges related to these reviews, limited interest in purchasing or leasing VA properties and competition for funding with other important VA projects directly related to veterans' care are ongoing challenges that continue to hinder disposal efforts. VA officials and stakeholders GAO spoke with also identified property characteristics that affect the marketability of VA properties\u2014historic status, deficient physical conditions, location, unusable building configuration, and repair costs\u2014as barriers for disposal. VA officials and stakeholders GAO spoke with also noted that it is unclear what specific steps need to be taken for disposals, what are the targeted time frames for completing those steps, and who is responsible for completing them.

In 2011, President Obama announced that the United States would rebalance its military presence and posture toward the Asia-Pacific region. GAO was asked to review DOD's rebalance efforts. This report examines the extent to which DOD has developed strategy documents to guide the rebalance to the Pacific that include desired elements of an effective national strategy. GAO reviewed DOD's strategy documents and interviewed DOD officials from multiple offices involved in planning, implementing, and evaluating the rebalance to the Pacific. GAO also reviewed six DOD strategy documents that were issued between 2012 and 2015 that were relevant and representative of DOD's previous strategy to implement the rebalance to the Pacific. What GAO Found The Department of Defense (DOD) has developed strategy documents to guide the rebalance to the Pacific that include most of the desired elements of an effective national strategy. GAO's prior work has shown that effective national strategies incorporate six characteristics, and their associated desired elements. GAO found six DOD strategy documents that collectively guided the rebalance to the Pacific collectively included most of the desired elements of an effective national strategy. For example, as a set, the six strategy documents contained a detailed description of the operating environment in which activities for the rebalance were to take place and included references that described the relationship of the rebalance to other strategies, goals, and objectives. Collectively, the six strategy documents referred to selected types of resources needed, such as the deployment of ships and aviation assets, and who would be implementing the strategies. GAO was, however, unable to find any reference to 7 of the 31 desired elements in any of the six strategy documents. For example, 2 of the 7 missing elements were: Lack of a documented, consistent definition of the rebalance to the Pacific. Based on GAO's systematic review, GAO found that none of DOD's six strategy documents from 2012 to 2015 identified an end state for the rebalance to the Pacific. Identifying the end state is a desired element associated with establishing goals and objectives for effective strategies and plans. Joint doctrine also states that military planners must know where to",
    "gao_GAO-18-347": "Why GAO Did This Study Tickets to popular events are often sold on the secondary market, where multiple sellers can list their tickets for sale and connect with potential buyers. However, some consumers are concerned about the extent to which tickets are sold at face value. GAO was asked to review ticketing issues. This report examines (1) how ticketing practices, prices, fees, and resale affect consumers and (2) the extent to which federal agencies address ticketing issues. GAO reviewed relevant federal laws, regulations, and studies; analyzed data from a nongeneralizable sample of 22 events; and interviewed federal, state, and industry officials, industry representatives, and consumer advocates. What GAO Found The concert, sports, and theater industries vary in how they price and distribute tickets. Many tickets are resold on the secondary market, typically at a higher price. Ticketing practices for major concerts include presales and pricing that varies based on factors like location and the popularity of the performer. Tickets to popular events are often first sold through presales, which allow certain customers to purchase tickets before the general on-sale. Common presales include those for holders of certain credit cards or members of the artist's fan club, although promoters, venues, or other groups also may offer presales. Tickets to popular events are often resold on the secondary market, typically at a higher price. Among a nongeneralizable sample of events GAO reviewed, GAO observed that primary and secondary market ticketing companies charged total fees averaging 27 percent and 31 percent, respectively, of the ticket's price. Ticketing fees varied among the primary and secondary markets, and among different ticketing companies and events. For the 23 events GAO reviewed, the largest ticketing company frequently did not display its fees prominently or early in the purchase process. For 14 of the 23 events, fees could be learned only by selecting a seat, clicking through one or two additional screens, creating a user name and password (or logging in), and clicking an icon labeled \"Order Details,\" which displayed the face-value price and the fees. Other consumer protection concerns that have been raised involve the amount charged for ticketing fees, speculative and fraudulent tickets, and designated resale exchanges.

This statement discusses (1) the extent to which the federal government has addressed information security deficiencies and (2) the key actions that the federal government and other entities need to take to address these challenges. This statement is based on GAO's prior work and ongoing work related to cybersecurity and privacy. GAO's work has included a review of relevant laws, regulations, and guidance; a review of relevant federal laws and regulations; and interviews with officials from the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), and other federal agencies. What GAO Found The federal government and the nation's critical infrastructure are dependent on IT systems and electronic data, which make them highly vulnerable to a wide and evolving array of cyber-based threats. Securing these systems and data is vital to the nation's security, prosperity, and well-being. Nevertheless, the security over these systems and data is inconsistent and urgent actions are needed to address ongoing cybersecurity and privacy challenges. Specifically, the federal government needs to implement a more comprehensive cybersecurity strategy and improve its oversight, including maintaining a qualified cybersecurity workforce; address security weaknesses in federal systems and information and enhance cyber incident response efforts; bolster the protection of cyber critical infrastructure; and prioritize efforts to protect individual's privacy and sensitive data.

Lifeline is a federal program that provides telephone service to eligible beneficiaries. FCC and USAC are responsible for administering the USF. GAO was asked to testify on the status of FCC's and USAC's efforts to address program risks. This statement is based on GAO's May 2017 report, Lifeline: FCC and USAC Have Taken Steps to Address Program Integrity Risks, but Weaknesses Remain, and GAO's May 2017 report, Lifeline: FCC and USAC Have Taken Steps to Improve Oversight of Lifeline Providers, but Remaining Gaps Could Allow Noncompliance with Program Rules (GAO-17-28). This statement is based on GAO's May 2017 report, Lifeline: FCC and USAC Have Taken Steps to Improve Oversight of Lifeline Providers, but Remaining Gaps Could Allow Noncompliance with Program Rules (GAO-17-28). GAO reviewed FCC and USAC documents and interviewed FCC and USAC officials. GAO also conducted 21 undercover tests of Lifeline providers to determine whether they were able to verify eligibility. What GAO Found The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) and the Universal Service Administration for the Uninsured (USAC) have taken steps to evaluate Lifeline's performance in meeting program goals, but GAO found that FCC has not evaluated Lifeline's effectiveness in achieving its performance goals of increasing telephone subscribership among low-income consumers while minimizing the burden on those who contribute to the Uninsured Supplemental Security Fund (USF). FCC has recently taken some steps toward evaluating Lifeline's performance in meeting program goals. For example, FCC instructed USAC to hire an outside, independent, third-party evaluator to complete a program evaluation of Lifeline's design, function, and administration. FCC generally agreed with GAO's recommendations. FCC and USAC have implemented controls to improve subscriber eligibility verification, such as implementing the National Lifeline Access Database in 2014, which helps carriers identify and resolve duplicate claims for Lifeline-supported services.

Allocating agencies are responsible for allocating credits to developers of qualified rental housing projects that reserve all or a portion of their units for low-income tenants. GAO was asked to review the LIHTC program. This statement discusses (1) key practices selected allocating agencies used to implement key LIHTC requirements and (2) IRS oversight of the program. This statement is based on GAO's 2016 report, Low-Income Housing Tax Credit: IRS Oversight Has Been Minimal, and (2) opportunities to enhance oversight of the LIHTC program by leveraging the knowledge and experience of HUD. GAO reviewed IRS guidance and regulations, analyzed 58 Low-Income Housing Tax Credit (LIHTC) program plans, and interviewed agency officials. What GAO Found GAO found in 2016 that allocating agencies implemented requirements for key LIHTC requirements in varying ways and had processes in place to meet requirements for credit awards. Allocating agencies also had procedures to assess costs, but determined award amounts for projects differently, used various cost limits and benchmarks to determine reasonableness of costs, and used widely varying criteria for basis boosts. Allocating agencies also had processes in place to monitor compliance. However, some of these practices raised concerns. IRS conducted few reviews of allocating agencies and had not reviewed how agencies determined basis boosts. Data on noncompliance were not reliable and IRS used little of the reported program information. IRS had not directly participated in an interagency initiative to augment HUD's databases with LIHTC property inspection data.

    "gao_GAO-18-341": "Why GAO Did This Study CMS has established a program to ensure that Medicare coverage and payment rules have been met before the agency pays for selected items and services. CMS has implemented four prior authorization programs for items and services, and a permanent program for certain durable medical equipment, prosthetics, orthotics, and supplies. GAO was asked to review the use of prior authorization. This report examines (1) the extent to which expenditures for items and services subject to prior authorization have been reduced and potential savings may be as high as $1.1 to $1.9 billion, and (2) the extent to which CMS monitors and evaluates prior authorization and has plans for continuing prior authorization. GAO analyzed Medicare expenditure data from implementation through March 2017, reviewed relevant laws and regulations, and interviewed CMS officials. What GAO Found According to GAO's analysis, expenditures for items and services subject to prior authorization have been reduced in four demonstrations. For example, expenditure decreases in initial demonstration states from implementation through March 2017 ranged from 17 percent to 74 percent. GAO estimates potential savings for items and services subject to prior authorization in states that were part of the demonstrations since either their initial implementation or expansion may be as high as $1.1 billion. For items and services subject to prior authorization in these states, estimated expenditures in the absence of the demonstrations would have been over $2.1 billion, while actual expenditures were about $1.0 billion. CMS had other program integrity efforts underway before implementing prior authorization, and these efforts may have also contributed to the reduction in expenditures for those select items and services. CMS officials said that it is likely that prior authorization played a large role in the expenditure reduction for those select items and services. However, CMS officials reported that it is difficult to separate the effects of prior authorization from other program integrity efforts, and the agency has not developed a methodology for determining the independent effect of prior authorization on expenditures. Many of the officials GAO interviewed representing provider, supplier, and beneficiary groups, as well as CMS and the Medicare Administrative Contractors (MAC) that process claims, reported benefits to prior authorization. For example, some officials said that prior authorization helps educate providers and suppliers about allowable items and services under Medicare and improves providers' and suppliers' documentation.

    "gao_GAO-17-809T": "Why GAO Did This Study The Navy has experienced four significant mishaps at sea since January 2017, resulting in serious damage to Navy ships and the loss of 17 sailors. The Navy has also reported persistently low readiness levels. This testimony discusses (1) the Navy's progress in addressing its persistently low readiness levels and (2) the extent to which the Navy has implemented its readiness rebuilding efforts. This statement is based on GAO reports issued from September 2009 through August 2017 and selected updates conducted in August 2017 to include information on maintenance status and readiness recovery. GAO analyzed Navy data on ship maintenance and readiness recovery for fiscal years 2009 through 2017, reviewed relevant guidance, and interviewed Navy officials. What GAO Found Since 2006, the Navy has assigned more of its surface combatants and amphibious ships to overseas homeports. In 2006, 20 ships were homeported overseas (7 percent of the fleet), today, 40 ships are homeported overseas (14 percent of the fleet) in Japan, Spain, Bahrain, and Italy; and an additional destroyer will be homeported in Yokosuka, Japan in 2018. According to the Navy, homeporting ships overseas is an efficient method for providing forward presence and rapid crisis response. GAO's prior work confirms that having ships homeported overseas provides additional presence, but it comes at a cost. For example, GAO found in May 2015 that homeporting ships overseas results in higher operations and support costs than homeporting ships in the United States. In addition, the operational schedules the Navy uses for overseas-homeported ships limit dedicated training and maintenance periods, resulting in difficulty keeping crews fully trained and ships maintained. In May 2015, GAO recommended that the Navy develop and implement a sustainable operational schedule for all ships homeported overseas. DOD concurred and reported in 2015 that it had developed revised operational schedules for all ships homeported overseas. However, when GAO contacted DOD in August 2017, U.S. Pacific Fleet officials stated that the revised operational schedules for the cruisers and destroyers homeported in Japan were still under review and had not been employed. As of June 2017, 37 percent of the warfare certifications for cruiser and destroyer crews homeported in Japan had expired, and over two-thirds of the expired certifications\u2014including mobility-seamanship and air warfare\u2014had been expired for 5 months or more.

CBP also collects and uses EAD to target mail for inspection. This testimony discusses (1) the extent to which CBP and USPS have used EAD to target mail for inspection and (2) the costs and benefits of using EAD to target mail for inspection. This statement is based on GAO's report, Inbound International Mail Security: CBP Seizes a Variety of Inbound Items that May Pose Threats to U.S. Safety and Security (GAO-08-282). GAO reviewed CBP data on seizures of inbound international items and interviewed CBP and USPS officials. What GAO Found According to data from the U.S. Customs and Border Protection's (CBP) Seized Asset and Case Tracking System (SEACATS), during fiscal years 2012 through 2016, CBP conducted about 308,000 seizures of inbound international items that may pose a threat to U.S. security, health and safety, business, and ecology. Of those, CBP seized about 70 percent from mail and 30 percent from express cargo. USPS and CBP have not used EAD to target mail for inspection outside of pilot programs. According to USPS documents, the goal of these pilots is to test the effectiveness of placing holds on mail that has been targeted by CBP based on EAD. At the time of GAO's review, CBP did not use EAD to target mail for inspection outside of these pilots. According to USPS documents, the goal of these pilots is to test the effectiveness of placing holds on mail that has been targeted by CBP based on EAD. Since the pilots began, USPS has made efforts to locate and provide CBP with the targeted mail and CBP has collected performance data on the percentage of targeted mail USPS has provided for inspection: about 82 percent for one pilot, and about 58 percent for the other. In GAO's report, GAO found that the costs and benefits of using EAD to target mail for inspection are unclear. For example, according to USPS and CBP officials, increasing the use of EAD to target mail for inspection may have benefits, such as reducing the volume of inspected mail and increasing the percentage of inspection",

In April 2017, GAO reported that NNSA's budget estimates for its modernization programs sometimes exceeded the budgetary projections included in the President's budgets for that period. GAO also reported that the costs of some major modernization programs\u2014such as for nuclear weapon refurbishments\u2014may also increase and further strain future modernization budgets. This statement discusses (1) the extent to which NNSA's modernization budget estimates support the scope of its modernization efforts, and (2) DOE's efforts to improve management of contracts, projects, and programs. This statement is based on GAO's April 2017 report, Modernizing the Nuclear Security Enterprise: NNSA's Budget Estimates Do Not Fully Align with Plans (GAO-17-290), and April 2017 report on DOE's environmental cleanup efforts (GAO-17-537) and contract and project management (GAO-17-577). GAO also reviewed NNSA's fiscal year 2017 budget materials and interviewed agency officials. What GAO Found GAO found that the National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA) may have to defer certain modernization work planned for fiscal years 2018 through 2021 beyond its current 5-year planning period, called the Future-Years Nuclear Security Program (FYNSP), to execute its program within the planned budget, which could increase modernization costs and schedule risks. This is a pattern GAO has previously identified as a \"bow wave\"\u2014an increase in future years' estimated budget needs that occurs when agencies are undertaking more programs than their resources can support. In the long-term (fiscal years 2022 through 2026), GAO found that NNSA's modernization program budget estimates sometimes exceeded the projected budgetary resources planned for inclusion in the President's budget, raising additional questions about whether NNSA will be able to afford the scope of its modernization program. Second, the costs of some major modernization programs\u2014such as for nuclear weapon refurbishments\u2014may also increase and further strain future modernization budgets.

GAO was asked to review discipline issues in public schools. This report examines (1) the patterns in disciplinary actions among public schools, (2) the challenges selected school districts reported with student behavior and how they are approaching discipline, and (3) actions the Department of Education and Justice have taken to identify and address any disparities or discrimination in school discipline. GAO analyzed federal discipline data by student demographics and school characteristics; visited five school districts to provide illustrative examples of approaches to discipline; and interviewed federal agency officials and reviewed agency documentation, federal laws, regulations, and selected state laws. What GAO Found Black students, boys, and students with disabilities were disproportionately disciplined in K-12 public schools, according to GAO's analysis of Department of Education's most recent Civil Rights Data Collection (CRDC) data. This pattern of disproportionate discipline persisted regardless of the type of disciplinary action, level of school poverty, or type of public school these students attended. For example, Black students represented 15.5 percent of all public school students and accounted for 39 percent of students suspended from school, an overrepresentation of about 23 percentage points. Across each disciplinary action, Black students, boys, and students with disabilities experienced disproportionate levels of discipline. Black students were particularly overrepresented among students who were suspended from school, received corporal punishment, or had a school-related arrest. For example, Black students represented 15.5 percent of all public school students and accounted for 39 percent of students suspended from school, an overrepresentation of about 23 percentage points. Regardless of the type of public school a student attended\u2014traditional, magnet, charter, alternative, or special education\u2014Black students, boys, and students with disabilities were disciplined at disproportionately higher rates than their peers, with few exceptions. For example, Black students were disproportionately overrepresented among students who received corporal punishment, by about 27 percentage points.

The National Guard program was established nearly 30 years ago to assist efforts of the Governors of the 50 states, District of Columbia, and three U.S. territories in addressing illicit drug production, trade, and consumption. The National Guard program is funded through DOD's Drug Interdiction and Counterdrug Activities, Defense account. GAO was asked to review DOD's National Guard counterdrug program. This report examines the extent to which DOD (1) has a strategy and guidance for the National Guard counterdrug program, (2) has processes for approving and distributing funds to state counterdrug programs, and (3) has incorporated DOD's strategic counternarcotics priorities into its funding distribution process. GAO reviewed DOD's counternarcotics and global threats strategy, analyzed DOD data, and interviewed officials from DOD, the National Guard Bureau, and the states. What GAO Found The Department of Defense's (DOD) 2011 Counternarcotics and Global Threats Strategy, the governing strategy for the National Guard counterdrug program, is outdated and does not reflect current drug threats outlined in more recent executive branch strategies. While the 2011 Counternarcotics and Global Threats Strategy shares common themes with the updated executive branch strategies, such as the importance of combatting transnational criminal organizations involved in drug trafficking, it has not been updated to reflect changes in the drug threats faced by the United States that are outlined by the more recent executive branch strategies. DOD officials acknowledged that because the process to update its strategic framework requires less review than a full strategy, DOD could quickly update it, if necessary, to ensure that it aligns with a new National Drug Control Strategy once one is released. Without a DOD counternarcotics and global threats strategic framework that reflects DOD's current strategic priorities and drug threats, the National Guard counterdrug program risks focusing activities and resources in areas that are less imperative to address than others and that do not counter current drug threats.

HFAs are required to disburse funds by December 2017. HHF programs are governed by participation agreements with Treasury. GAO was asked to review HHF. This report (1) determines the extent to which Treasury's monitoring of HHF addresses leading practices for program oversight, (2) provides information on HFAs' active programs and the status of HFAs' progress toward program targets, and (3) describes challenges in implementing HHF programs that HFAs and others identified. GAO analyzed Treasury's policies and procedures, interviewed HFAs, and analyzed HHF program data as of December 2017. What GAO Found The Department of the Treasury's (Treasury) monitoring of the Hardest Hit Fund (HHF) addresses 10 leading monitoring practices, including practices related to the collection of periodic performance reports and validation of performance through site visits. However, Treasury's assessment of HFAs' internal control programs, development of performance indicators, documentation of goals and measures, and documentation of HFAs' monitoring could better address leading practices. Treasury's policies and procedures to monitor HHF address 10 leading monitoring practices, including practices related to the collection of periodic performance reports and validation of performance through site visits. However, Treasury's assessment of HFAs' internal control programs, development of performance indicators, documentation of goals and measures, and documentation of HFAs' monitoring could better address leading practices. Treasury created quantitative output and outcome measures to assess HFAs' performance. However, some of Treasury's performance measures are not clearly stated and Treasury did not create consistent methodologies for HFAs to use to assess the performance of their HHF programs. Treasury also required HFAs to report some outcomes, both intended and unintended, until a household is no longer involved with an HHF program. Treasury did not design a consistent methodology for HFAs to use in setting these targets because, in their view, HFAs are most familiar with local conditions and should have flexibility in adjusting the program criteria or creating new programs based on these conditions. Treasury also required HFAs with blight elimination and down payment assistance programs to identify indicators that are intended to track and quantify the HHF program's impact on targeted areas, although HFAs are not required to report outcomes data to Treasury in their quarterly",

The program's contractors are developing crew transportation systems to help the United States re-establish its domestic ability to provide crew access to the International Space Station. In September 2014, NASA awarded firm-fixed-price contracts to Boeing and SpaceX, valued at up to $4.2 billion and $2.6 billion, respectively, for the Commercial Crew Transportation Capability phase. The contracts are fixed-price contracts, which are generally not subject to the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR).

This statement is based on GAO's February 2017 report, Commercial Crew: Progress Has Made, but Delays Could Further Delay Certification (GAO-17-452). GAO reviewed NASA and contractor documents and interviewed program officials. What GAO Found The National Aeronautics and Space Administration's (NASA) Commercial Crew Program's contractors have made progress developing their crew transportation systems, but both also have aggressive development schedules that are increasingly under pressure. Both Boeing and SpaceX had determined that they would not be able to meet their original 2017 certification dates, and both expected certification to be delayed until 2018. GAO found that the schedule pressures were amplified by NASA's need to provide a viable crew transportation option to the International Space Station before its current contract with Russia's space agency runs out in 2019. If NASA needs to purchase additional seats from Russia, the contracting process typically takes 3 years. Without a viable contingency option for ensuring uninterrupted access to the ISS in the event of further Commercial Crew delays, GAO found that NASA was at risk of not being able to maximize the return on its multibillion dollar investment in the space station. The Commercial Crew Program was using mechanisms laid out in its contracts to gain a high level of visibility into the contractors' crew transportation systems, but maintaining the current level of visibility through certification could add to the program's schedule pressures. For example, due to NASA's acquisition strategy for this program, its personnel are less involved in the testing, launching, and operation of the crew transportation system. Moving forward though, GAO found that the program office could face difficult choices about how to maintain the level of visibility it feels it",

VBA contracts with contractors to provide exams and to complete quality reviews of contractors' exam reports. GAO was asked to review VBA's contract exam program. This report examines (1) VBA's monitoring of contractor performance and VBA oversight of contracted examiners' qualifications and training, and (2) VBA's oversight of contracted examiners' qualifications and training. GAO analyzed VBA data on disability compensation exams completed between February 2017 and January 2018, and interviewed agency officials. What GAO Found The Department of Veterans Affairs' (VA) Veterans Benefits Administration (VBA) reported that almost all contractors missed VBA's quality target of 92 percent in the first half of calendar year 2017, and more recent data are not yet available for most districts. VBA reported that almost all contractors missed VBA's quality target of 92 percent in the first half of calendar year 2017, and more recent data are not yet available for most districts. VBA-determined quarterly quality scores\u2014the percentage of disability compensation exam reports with no errors as measured against VBA criteria\u2014for the seven contracts used by VBA in calendar year 2017 showed that contractors were frequently well below the quality target. However, VBA has not yet completed all of the quality reviews used to calculate contractor quality scores, particularly for exams that were completed in the second half of 2017. VBA officials said that they closely monitor contractors' workloads and help expedite requested exams that have exceeded VBA's targets for completing exams. VBA's lack of reliable data on the status of exams, including insufficient exams\u2014exam reports that VBA returns to contractors to be corrected or clarified\u2014limits its ability to effectively oversee certain contract provisions. VBA officials acknowledged that they could not calculate the number of completed exams that were once marked as insufficient or how long they had remained in that status due to the data limitations of the exam management system the agency used until spring 2018. The contracts require that contractors correct insufficient exams within a certain number of days and bill VBA for these exams at half price. However, VBA's lack of complete and reliable information on insufficient exams hinders its ability to ensure that either of these requirements is met. VBA officials also indicated that they were unable to fully assess individual contractor timeliness against VBA's performance targets because the exam management system did not include the date",
    "gao_GAO-18-402": "Why GAO Did This Study Utilities are increasingly integrating energy storage into grid infrastructure to help meet demand. Storage can help address the reliability of grid operations by helping grid operators respond to fluctuations in electricity supply resulting from the variability of renewable energy resources, such as solar or wind, or disruptions to the grid, such as the loss of a transmission line or a generating unit. GAO was asked to review the deployment of energy storage. This report examines (1) how energy storage can enhance the reliability, resilience, and efficiency of grid operations, and (2) the extent to which federal and state policies and other efforts encourage the deployment of energy storage and address market barriers. GAO reviewed studies and documents, and interviewed stakeholders, including federal and state regulators, utilities, and storage providers. What GAO Found Energy storage can be used in various ways to enhance the reliability, resilience, and efficiency of grid operations, according to studies GAO reviewed and stakeholders GAO interviewed. Energy storage can be deployed throughout the electricity system and act as a generation, transmission, distribution, or customer-sited asset to provide various services, address operational challenges and needs, and potentially reduce costs. For example, storage can help grid operators respond to fluctuations in electricity supply resulting from the variability of renewable energy resources, such as solar or wind, or disruptions to the grid, such as the loss of a transmission line or a generating unit. Moreover, storage can provide ancillary services needed to maintain system reliability and support the transmission of electricity. For example, storage can provide frequency regulation services\u2014which entail moment-to-moment reconciliation of the difference between supply and demand\u2014to maintain the stability of the system. Storage also has the potential to reduce costs by avoiding or delaying investments in infrastructure. Various factors affect the deployment of energy storage for grid operations, including industry and technology readiness, safety concerns and stringency of siting requirements, increasing use of renewable resources, the cost-competitiveness of storage, and the regulatory environment. For example, industry and technology readiness. According to studies GAO reviewed and stakeholders GAO interviewed, industry and technology readiness is a key factor in determining the value of storage. However, the cost of storage systems\u2014including all system components, installation, and integration costs\u2014is still high when compared to more traditional resources available to electric utilities, according to studies GAO reviewed and stakeholders GAO interviewed.

DHS initiated three projects for modernizing the systems of selected DHS components, including its TRIO project. GAO was asked to review the TRIO project. This report examines the extent to which DHS followed best practices in analyzing the alternatives used in choosing the preferred alternative for modernizing TRIO components' financial management systems. GAO analyzed relevant documentation and interviewed DHS, IBC, and USSM officials. What GAO Found The Department of Homeland Security's (DHS) TRIO components\u2014the U.S. Coast Guard (Coast Guard), Transportation Security Administration (TSA), and Domestic Nuclear Detection Office (DNDO)\u2014conducted alternatives analyses (AA) to identify the preferred alternative for modernizing their financial management systems. However, their efforts did not always follow best practices. For example, Coast Guard's and TSA's AAs supporting their selection of migrating to a federal service provider (SSP) for modernizing their financial management systems did not fully or substantially meet all four characteristics of a reliable, high-quality AOA process. In addition, GAO found that DHS guidance did not fully or substantially incorporate five of GAO's identified best practices for conducting an AOA process. The TRIO components' AAs included descriptions of the key factors, such as scores for each alternative against the selection criteria used to assess it. Based on these AAs, DHS and the TRIO components selected the federal SSP alternative as their preferred choice and subsequently selected IBC as their federal SSP. However, because Coast Guard's and TSA's AAs did not fully or substantially meet all four characteristics of a reliable, high-quality AOA process, they are at increased risk regarding their decision on the solution that represents the best alternative for meeting their mission needs. DHS and the TRIO components conducted market research to develop reasonable alternatives for consideration and selected the federal SSP alternative as their preferred choice and subsequently selected IBC as their federal SSP.

    "gao_GAO-18-94": "Why GAO Did This Study In the past decade, school choice options have expanded across the country, providing more education alternatives for students and families. GAO was asked to review the accountability mechanisms in private school choice programs. This report examines (1) the academic, administrative, and financial accountability mechanisms in private school choice programs; (2) the information available to the public and prospective families on private school choice programs and participating private schools; and (3) how families of students with disabilities are informed about any changes in their rights under federal law when enrolling in private school choice programs, and how the U.S. Department of Education provides information to families about these rights. GAO reviewed relevant federal laws, regulations, and guidance; analyzed program documents and interviewed officials from the U.S. Department of Education (Education), national school choice organizations, and private school choice researchers; and conducted site visits to five states (Arizona, Florida, Indiana, Ohio, and Wisconsin). What GAO Found Most private school choice programs have academic accountability mechanisms, which can include requirements for participating private schools to administer tests, report testing results, obtain accreditation, and teach core subjects. However, most programs have some administrative accountability mechanisms, such as hiring teachers and other staff with specific qualifications or credentials. Officials from six private school choice programs described various approaches to monitoring participating schools' compliance with their programs' academic, administrative, and financial accountability requirements. For example, officials in one program described being concerned that a particular school's buildings were unsafe. Officials in another program described being concerned that a particular school's buildings were unsafe but did not have authority to deny participation in the program based on financial criteria. Private school choice programs and participating schools provide a range of information to the public and prospective families, but the information included\u2014and the way it is provided\u2014varies. For example, 21 of 27 programs provide contact information, and 20 programs provide information on grades served. Nearly all private school choice programs provide a directory of participating private schools for the public and prospective families, although the information included\u2014and the way it is provided\u2014varies. For example, 21 of 27 programs provide contact information, and 20 programs provide information on grades served. Nearly all private school choice programs provide information on students with disabilities, and most websites do not have information related to special education services. In addition, GAO found that 9 of 27 programs did not provide any information about these changes in rights. Moreover, among the 15 programs specifically",

DEA authorizes the public to deliver unused prescription drugs to an entity authorized by DEA to dispose of them. The Disposal Act amended the Controlled Substances Act to allow the public to deliver unused controlled substances to an entity authorized by DEA to dispose of the substances. GAO was asked to review unused prescription drugs. This report examines (1) the extent to which eligible entities have chosen to become DEA-authorized collectors of unused prescription drugs, and (2) factors that may explain why relatively few pharmacies and other eligible entities have chosen to become authorized collectors of unused prescription drugs. GAO analyzed DEA data on the number of eligible entities and participating entities, reviewed relevant laws and regulations, and interviewed officials from 11 stakeholders, which represent authorized collectors and long-term care facilities. What GAO Found About 3 percent of eligible entities\u2014retail pharmacies, hospitals/clinics with an on-site pharmacy, narcotic treatment programs, reverse distributors, distributors, and drug manufacturers that are already authorized by the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) to handle controlled substances\u2014have voluntarily chosen to become DEA-authorized collectors of unused prescription drugs, according to DEA data. As of April 2017, 2,233 of the 89,550 eligible entities\u2014which are already authorized by DEA to handle controlled substances\u2014had registered to use disposal bins to collect unused prescription drugs. Most of the authorized collectors\u2014about 81 percent\u2014were pharmacies, followed by hospitals or clinics. The remaining 1 percent\u2014reverse distributors, distributors, and drug manufacturers\u2014made up approximately 1 percent of the authorized collectors. GAO also found that participation rates varied by state, though in most states relatively few of the eligible entities had registered with DEA to become authorized collectors. As of April 2017, about half of the country's population lived less than 5 miles away from a pharmacy or other DEA-authorized entity offering a prescription disposal bin. According to officials from 11 stakeholders, several factors may explain why relatively few pharmacies and other eligible entities have chosen to become authorized collectors of unused prescription drugs. These factors include the associated costs of participating, uncertainty over proper implementation, and participation in other, similar efforts for disposing of unused prescription drugs.

The National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2015 included a provision for GAO to review DOD's implementation of the recommendations from the 2014 nuclear enterprise reviews and the 2015 NC3 report. This report examines the extent to which DOD has (1) implemented the recommendations from the 2014 nuclear enterprise reviews and (2) implemented recommended changes to its personnel reliability assurance programs. GAO reviewed DOD's and the military services' processes for implementing the recommendations from the 2014 nuclear enterprise reviews and the 2015 NC3 report, and interviewed DOD officials. What GAO Found The Department of Defense (DOD) and the military services have made progress in implementing recommendations to improve the defense nuclear enterprise but could improve their efforts by identifying additional performance measures, milestones, and associated risks. DOD continues to implement the recommendations from the 2014 nuclear enterprise reviews, but the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2015 (NC3) report closed 77 of the 247 sub-recommendations from the 2014 nuclear enterprise reviews.

For example, the NC3 report recommended that U.S. Strategic Command review and validate the availability requirements of one of the NC3 systems, which the command has now completed. DOD has made progress in implementing the remaining 11 recommendations. For example, the NC3 report recommended that U.S. Strategic Command review and validate the availability requirements of one of the NC3 systems, which the command has now completed. Additional detail about DOD's progress is omitted because the information is classified. DOD's processes for tracking and evaluating its progress in implementing the recommendations from the 2014 nuclear enterprise reviews and the 2015 NC3 report do not consistently identify and document risks, and its processes for tracking and evaluating its progress in implementing the recommendations from the 2014 nuclear enterprise reviews do not identify performance measures, milestones, or risks.

The Aviation Security Act of 2016 includes a provision for GAO to review TSA's foreign airport assessment and air carrier inspection programs. This report (1) describes steps TSA has taken to enhance foreign airport assessments and air carrier inspections since 2011, (2) describes the results of TSA's foreign airport assessments and air carrier inspections, and (3) examines steps TSA takes to address any deficiencies identified during foreign airport assessments and air carrier inspections. GAO reviewed relevant laws and regulations, analyzed TSA's foreign airport assessment and air carrier inspection data, and interviewed TSA officials and other federal and nonfederal stakeholders. What GAO Found Since 2011, the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) has taken steps to enhance its foreign airport assessment and air carrier inspection programs, including targeting resources based on risk, strengthening access to foreign airports, and creating operational efficiencies. For example, TSA established the Northern Virginia Regional Operations Center (ROC) in Northern Virginia to oversee North Africa and the Middle East given the high risk associated with many airports in the region. TSA also conducted more targeted foreign airport assessments, which focus on specific areas of concern. TSA also developed job aids for inspectors to assess for security requirements. TSA also established the Honolulu Regional Operations Center (ROC) in Honolulu, which allowed the agency to reduce costs and travel time to airports in these locations. TSA's foreign airport assessment data showed variations in compliance by region and across international aviation security standards, while air carrier inspection data showed that most inspections were fully compliant. TSA officials stated that while these challenges are not easy to overcome, agency efforts, such as training host country staff, can help foreign airports reduce their vulnerability scores over time. According to air carrier inspection data maintained by TSA, between fiscal years 2012 and 2016, air carriers providing last point of departure service to the United States from foreign airports complied with all TSA security requirements in most inspections. For those inspections that identified noncompliance, data from TSA showed that the majority of violations were corrected or addressed immediately through on-the-spot counseling. TSA also offers capacity development assistance to foreign airports, including on-the-spot counseling, training,",
    "gao_GAO-19-64": "Why GAO Did This Study DOD's labs are responsible for supporting warfighter needs and developing transformative capabilities. Congress has provided DOD lab directors with key authorities to foster innovation and efficiency. GAO was asked to review DOD's use of these authorities. This report examines (1) how DOD labs have used selected legislative authorities to foster innovation and efficiency and identify what barriers impede their use; (2) identifies and describes governance models used by selected DOD-sponsored federally funded research centers and university affiliated research centers; and (3) identifies and describes governance models used by non-defense labs, specifically at the Department of Energy (Energy) and National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA). GAO surveyed DOD lab directors and reviewed relevant legislation, DOD guidance, and relevant DOD and service policies. GAO also interviewed officials from DOD, Energy, and NASA. What GAO Found Most defense labs have used the selected legislative authorities to foster innovation and efficiency and identify what barriers impede their use. Twenty-three of 31 of the 31 lab directors to GAO's survey reported obligating funds under this authority. However, GAO found that most labs are not using the full 4 percent of all funds available to each lab, or charging customers the full fixed percentage fee of 4 percent of costs, as allowed by law. For example, Navy labs reported charging customers a percentage fee of about 2 percent of costs as of fiscal year 2018. The Army's Aviation and Missile Research, Development, and Engineering Center reported that it is nearly impossible to construct lab facilities for less than $6 million. Air Force lab officials stated that they have primarily used funds to renovate existing buildings rather than fund new lab facility construction. The Navy's labs have missed out on, and continue to miss, opportunities to invest in needed improvements to its aging lab infrastructure. The Army has not assessed its policy to determine whether changes are needed to eliminate these disincentives. Continuing to use without such an assessment could result in Army labs using the laboratory initiated research authority to fund fewer self-initiated projects\u2014with the downstream effect that fewer new technologies for warfighters are available.

In November 2014, DOD directed CAPE to track and assess implementation of the recommendations from the 2014 nuclear enterprise reviews. In response, CAPE compiled the recommendations from the 2014 reviews and identified 247 sub-recommendations within those recommendations, which were directed to multiple military services or other DOD components. GAO was asked to review DOD's implementation of the recommendations from the 2014 nuclear enterprise reviews. This report examines the extent to which DOD has (1) implemented and tracked recommendations from the 2014 nuclear enterprise reviews and (2) improved oversight of the defense nuclear enterprise. GAO reviewed relevant DOD guidance and interviewed DOD officials. What GAO Found The Department of Defense (DOD) continues to make progress in implementing the recommendations from the 2014 nuclear enterprise reviews and has made improvements in tracking and evaluating this progress. Specifically, the military services and other DOD components have begun identifying and documenting risks associated with implementing recommendations from the 2014 reviews, based on guidance that was issued by the Defense Acquisition Program Executive Office (CAPE) in January 2018. DOD has also made progress in implementing the recommendations from the 2015 National Defense Authorization Act (NC3) report. For example, the Air Force has completed its portion of two of the open recommendations, but the Navy still has tasks it needs to complete before each recommendation can be reviewed and closed by the NLC3S Council. As a result, these two recommendations will remain \"in progress\" until the Air Force also completes its portion of the implementation. In addition, a DOD component has recommended that an additional 2 of the 13 recommendations be closed; however, these have not yet been reviewed by the NLC3S Council. DOD and the military services have taken steps to improve oversight of the defense nuclear enterprise, in part in response to recommendations from the 2014 nuclear enterprise reviews. DOD plans to use the NDERG to oversee long-term and enduring issues affecting the nuclear enterprise. However, the NDERG does not have formally defined roles and responsibilities, and DOD has not established methods for how the NDERG will communicate and collaborate with other nuclear enterprise oversight organizations.

FRA is responsible for overseeing PTC implementation and providing assistance to railroads. In anticipation of the upcoming deadline, FRA began to send notification letters to railroads it determined were at risk of both not meeting the end of 2018 implementation deadline and not completing the requirements necessary to qualify for an extension. This testimony discusses (1) the status of passenger railroads' implementation of PTC and FRA's efforts to ensure that they are in compliance with PTC implementation requirements, and (2) the extent to which FRA and the nation's passenger railroads are poised for full PTC implementation by December 31, 2020. This statement is based on GAO's body of work on PTC implementation and FRA's oversight of PTC implementation. GAO reviewed FRA documents and interviewed FRA officials and representatives from 29 passenger railroads, 13 commuter railroads, and 13 commuter railroads. What GAO Found As of June 30, 2018, many passenger railroads reported that they remain in the equipment installation and field-testing stages, which are early stages of PTC implementation. However, since GAO testified in March 2018, railroads have made progress on equipment installation. Specifically, 20 of the 29 passenger railroads reported being more than 90 percent complete with locomotive equipment installation. Nearly two-thirds of passenger railroads that must install wayside equipment reported being more than 90 percent complete. One-third of passenger railroads are among those designated by FRA as at-risk of both not meeting the end of 2018 implementation deadline and not completing the requirements necessary to qualify for an extension. Specifically, in August 2018, FRA identified nine railroads\u2014all commuter railroads\u2014as at-risk, fewer than the 12 railroads FRA had previously designated as at-risk in its June 2018 letters to railroads. FRA has recently clarified the extension requirements for passenger railroads. For example, FRA held three PTC symposiums that were attended by representatives from all 40 railroads and that focused on the extension process and substitute criteria, PTC testing, and safety plans, respectively.

In 2014, EPA reported that nutrient credit trading was used in 11 states and seven Environmental Protection Agency regions. GAO was asked to review nutrient credit trading. This report (1) examines the extent to which nutrient credit trading programs have been used and what the outcomes of the programs have been, (2) describes how states and EPA oversee nutrient credit programs, and (3) describes what key factors stakeholders view as affecting participation in nutrient credit trading. GAO reviewed EPA data and documents and interviewed officials from EPA, state, and other stakeholders. GAO also reviewed state laws and regulations, and a nongeneralizable sample of three nutrient credit trading programs in three states\u2014Connecticut, Pennsylvania, and Virginia\u2014and interviewed officials from EPA and other stakeholders. What GAO Found According to Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) data and interviews with EPA officials, in 2014, a total of 19 nutrient credit trading programs existed in 11 states. The majority of nutrient credit trades occurred in 3 states\u2014Connecticut, Pennsylvania, and Virginia\u2014which were also the largest programs in terms of the number of participating point sources. Most point sources participating in these three state programs did not purchase credits. However, EPA and state officials and stakeholders told GAO that trading provided point sources with flexibility that allowed them to manage risk, reduce the cost of compliance, and better manage the timing of upgrades of their nutrient removal technology. In the three states GAO reviewed, most point sources did not purchase credits to meet nutrient discharge limits, according to state data and officials. EPA and state officials and stakeholders told GAO that trading provided point sources with flexibility that allowed them to manage risk, reduce the cost of compliance, and better manage the timing of upgrades of their nutrient removal technology. EPA and state officials and stakeholders told GAO that nutrient credit trading was important because it gave point sources flexibility in meeting nutrient discharge limits. For example, in Connecticut, 14 percent of point sources in the trading program purchased credits in 2014\u2014the lowest percentage in the states GAO reviewed. In Pennsylvania, 29 percent of point sources purchased credits in 2014.

The ban on timber export and substitution was first implemented in the late 1960s. Since then, the timber economy has changed. The Forest Service and BLM have various regulations, policies, and procedures to carry out the ban. However, the agencies did not issue new regulations as required by the Forest Resources Conservation and Shortage Relief Act of 1997 and have not obtained legislative relief from this requirement. As a result, the agencies are relying on regulations issued before 1995. Without issuing new coordinated and consistent regulations or obtaining legislative relief, the agencies will continue to be out of compliance with the regulation provisions of the 1997 act. GAO was asked to review the Forest Service's and BLM's policies and practices to help prevent, detect, and respond to illegal timber export and substitution. This report examines (1) the extent to which the Forest Service and BLM have implemented the ban on timber export and substitution and (2) the extent to which the agencies have policies and practices to help prevent, detect, and respond to illegal timber export and substitution. GAO reviewed relevant laws, regulations, and policies; analyzed agency documents; and interviewed agency officials and stakeholders. What GAO Found The Forest Service and the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) found no violations of the ban on timber export and substitution from 2007 through 2017, and officials and stakeholders said the likelihood of illegal timber export and substitution is low. Forest Service officials identified four instances in which the agency investigated potential violations, but the reports were not substantiated. All agency officials and stakeholders said the likelihood of timber export and substitution violations is low due to a combination of several factors, including economic factors associated with log markets and changes in the organizational structure of timber companies. However, several officials acknowledged that some risk of violations exists under certain circumstances. For example, some Forest Service regional officials said that some national forests could be vulnerable to illegal timber export if log prices or demand for certain tree species increase in the future. The Forest Service and BLM neither issued new regulations as required by the Forest Resources Conservation and Shortage Relief Act of 1997 nor obtained legislative relief from the requirement. The agencies have policies and practices to help prevent, detect, and respond to illegal timber export and substitution. However, some policies are outdated or unclear, and the agencies have not reviewed their policies for continued relevance and effectiveness as called for by federal internal control standards.",
    "gao_GAO-18-466": "Why GAO Did This Study The federal government relies on information technology (IT) systems to carry out its missions. The Federal Cybersecurity Workforce Assessment Act of 2015 required OPM to develop a cybersecurity coding structure and procedures to identify all federal civilian cybersecurity positions. The act also required OPM to report on the progress of agencies' implementation of the act's requirements. GAO was asked to review the act's implementation. This report examines whether (1) OPM developed a coding structure and procedures for assigning codes to cybersecurity positions and submitted a progress report to Congress, (2) Chief Financial Officers (CFO) Act agencies submitted complete and reliable baseline assessment reports of their cybersecurity workforces, and (3) CFO Act agencies established procedures to identify and assign codes to cybersecurity positions. GAO reviewed relevant legislation, OPM guidance, and agency documents and interviewed cognizant officials. What GAO Found As required by the Federal Cybersecurity Workforce Assessment Act of 2015 (the act), the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) developed a cybersecurity coding structure under the National Initiative for Cybersecurity Education (NICE), issued guidance to implement the coding structure to identify all federal civilian cybersecurity positions, and provided a progress report to Congress on the implementation of the act. However, the coding structure and procedures were issued later than the act's deadlines because OPM was working with the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) to align the structure and procedures with the draft version of the NICE Cybersecurity Workforce Framework, which NIST issued later than planned. The delays in issuing the coding structure and procedures have extended the expected time frames for implementing subsequent provisions of the act. Specifically: The act required OPM, in coordination with NIST, to develop a cybersecurity coding structure by June 15, 2016. OPM addressed this requirement by developing a 3-digit cybersecurity employment coding structure that fully aligned with the NICE Cybersecurity Workforce Framework. OPM issued version 1 of the coding structure on November 15, 2016, 5 months after the act's deadline. The coding structure assigns a unique 3-digit cybersecurity employment code to each work role outlined in the draft version of the NICE Cybersecurity Workforce Framework, which NIST issued later than planned.

Counterfeit goods are often characterized by counterfeiters who attempt to deceive consumers into purchasing goods they believe are authentic. This shift has been accompanied by changes in the ways in which counterfeit goods are sold. GAO was asked to review the market for counterfeit goods. This statement discusses (1) the changes in the market for counterfeit goods, (2) key challenges that the changes in the market for counterfeit goods can pose to U.S. agencies and the private sector, and (3) the extent to which CBP and ICE collaborate on IPR enforcement. This statement is based on GAO's January 2018 report, Counterfeit: Challenges to U.S. Agencies and the Private Sector (GAO-2018-03-5).

GAO reviewed IHS data on vacancies and interviewed IHS officials in headquarters and 10 IHS areas with substantial direct care responsibilities, and seven IHS facilities in four of these areas. What GAO Found The Indian Health Service (IHS) data show large percentages of vacancies for providers in the 8 areas in which IHS has substantial direct care responsibilities. As of November 2017, the overall percentage of vacancies for physicians, nurses, nurse practitioners, certified nurse midwives, physician assistants, dentists, and pharmacists in these areas was 25 percent, ranging from 13 to 31 percent across the areas. However, variation in vacancy rates existed among provider types across IHS areas. For example, while the overall percentage of vacancies for physicians across these 8 areas was vacant, the vacancy rate for pharmacists was less than 25 percent. In addition, for certain provider types in some areas, more than one-third of the positions were vacant. IHS officials told GAO they have experienced considerable challenges filling vacancies for providers\u2014as well as negative effects on patient care and provider satisfaction when positions are vacant. According to IHS officials, the rural locations and geographic isolation of some IHS facilities create recruitment and retention difficulties. IHS officials said that the rural locations and geographic isolation of some IHS facilities create recruitment and retention difficulties. IHS officials said that, especially for job candidates and employees with families, these can be critical factors in choosing whether or not to accept or stay in a position. IHS uses strategies that are similar to strategies used by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) and tribal facilities in GAO's review. Specifically, IHS has provided financial incentives, professional development opportunities, and some access to housing. The agency has also taken steps to recruit students and connect with potential applicants through webinars, career fairs, and conferences. I",
    "gao_GAO-19-165": "Why GAO Did This Study Section 911 of the NDAA for Fiscal Year 2017 requires DOD to take several actions to address challenges that have hindered collaboration and integration across the department. Section 911 also requires DOD to reform its enterprise business operations to increase the effectiveness and efficiency of mission execution. Section 911 also requires DOD to establish nine cross-functional teams to implement initiatives intended to improve the quality and productivity of the department's business operations, including moving toward more use of enterprise services. Section 911 also requires GAO to report on DOD's implementation of section 911. This report examines the extent to which DOD has (1) addressed statutory requirements and (2) established and organized cross-functional teams to implement initiatives intended to improve the quality and productivity of the department's business operations. GAO reviewed relevant laws, DOD reports, and other documents; interviewed DOD officials; and conducted site visits to nine cross-functional teams. What GAO Found The Department of Defense (DOD) has addressed one statutory requirement of section 911 of the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) for Fiscal Year 2017 since GAO's June 2018 report. However, DOD has not addressed five other requirements, including (1) issuing its organizational strategy, (2) issuing guidance on cross-functional teams, (3) providing training on cross-functional teams for team members and their supervisors, (4) providing training for presidential appointees, and (5) taking actions to streamline the Office of the Secretary of Defense. DOD has addressed one of the statutory requirements in section 911 by submitting a report to Congress on the establishment of cross-functional teams on June 21, 2018. The report described the number of cross-functional teams established to date and the design and function of those teams, consistent with the requirements in section 911. DOD plans to address three of the five remaining requirements by March 2019. Specifically, DOD plans to take the following actions: (1) Issue DOD's organizational strategy. DOD has drafted, but not issued, its organizational strategy, which section 911 required to be issued by September 1, 2017. In June 2018, GAO reported that DOD officials had revised the draft strategy to address the recommendation from GAO's February 2018 report, including identifying potential action steps for the department that align with GAO's leading practices for mergers and organizational transformations. OCMO officials told GAO that DOD plans to issue the strategy in March 2019\u201418 months later than required by",
    "gao_GAO-18-623T": "Why GAO Did This Study In 2017, about one in four VAMCs had a physician workforce of about 9,000. In addition, VHA has been expanding its physician training program, which is intended to increase access and hire additional physicians. This statement discusses (1) the extent to which VHA has data on the total number of mission-critical physicians who provided care at VAMCs, and (2) how VHA recruits and retains its physician workforce. This statement is based on GAO's October 2017 report, Veterans Health Administration: Physician Recruitment and Retention Needed to Address Staffing Challenges, and (2) VHA's strategies for recruiting and retaining physicians. GAO reviewed VHA documents and interviewed VHA officials. What GAO Found In its October 2017 report, GAO found that the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) had data on the number of mission-critical physicians it employed (more than 11,000) and who provided services on a fee-basis (about 2,800), but lacked data on the number of contract physicians and physician trainees. As a result, VHA did not have data on the extent to which VAMCs used these arrangements and thus, underestimated its physician use overall. Therefore, VHA was unable to ensure that its workforce planning processes sufficiently addressed any gaps in staffing. All six VAMCs included in GAO's review used at least one type of arrangement other than employment for physicians, and five of the six used contract physicians or physician trainees. As a result, VHA was unable to ensure that its workforce planning processes sufficiently addressed any gaps in staffing. VHA gave responsibility for determining staffing needs to its VAMCs and provided its facilities with guidance, through policies and directives, on how to determine the number of physicians and support staff needed for some physician occupations. For these occupations, VHA provided guidance on the minimum number of physicians, but did not provide information on how to determine appropriate staffing levels for physicians or support staff based on the need for care. In its October 2017 report, GAO found that VHA used various strategies to recruit and retain its physician workforce, including providing assistance recruiting for mission-critical physician occupations through the National Recruitment Program; policies and guidance; financial incentives to enhance hiring and retention offers; and a national physician training program. However, VHA has not comprehensively evaluated its physician recruitment and retention strategies to assess their effectiveness. For",

ETA administers Job Corps, which is a federal agency that provides employment and training services to students. GAO was asked to review Job Corps safety and security. This report examines (1) what is known about the number and types of reported incidents involving the safety and security of Job Corps students in program year 2016, (2) what is known about student perceptions of safety and security at Job Corps centers, and (3) the extent to which ETA has taken steps to address safety and security at Job Corps centers. GAO analyzed ETA data on incidents reported by Job Corps centers in program year 2016 and interviewed ETA officials. GAO also conducted site visits at two Job Corps centers in three states selected based on geographic location and other factors. What GAO Found GAO's analysis of the Employment and Training Administration's (ETA) data showed that Job Corps centers reported 13,673 safety and security incidents involving students, including those that occurred both onsite and offsite, in program year 2016. During this time period (July 1, 2016, through June 30, 2017), approximately 79,000 students were served by the program. Drug-related incidents (29 percent) and assaults (19 percent) accounted for 48 percent of all reported incidents involving students. The remaining 52 percent of reported incidents involving students included breaches of security and safety (12 percent), alcohol-related incidents (6 percent), serious illness and injury (6 percent), theft or damage to property (5 percent), danger to self or others (5 percent), and all other types of incidents (18 percent). GAO cannot compare the number of reported incidents in program year 2016 to the number reported in a June 2017 testimony due to a policy change by ETA beginning July 1, 2016, which affected the categorization and number of reportable incidents. ETA officials said that the number of reported incidents has increased since July 1, 2016, due to these changes. GAO also found that about 17,000 students were reported as victims or perpetrators of all onsite and offsite incidents in program year 2016. Students generally reported feeling safe at Job Corps centers, but a smaller proportion reported feeling safe in certain situations. For example, 74 percent of students reported that they did not ever or in the last month carry a weapon, and 83 percent reported that it was very or mostly true that a student would be terminate",

DHS is required by law to identify and assign positions with cybersecurity functions and to report on its work categories and specialty areas of critical need. The act also required DHS to identify and report to Congress its department-wide cybersecurity work roles of critical need. GAO was asked to review DHS's efforts to identify and assign positions with cybersecurity functions. This report (1) identifies the extent to which DHS has: (1) identified, categorized, and assigned employment codes to positions; and (2) identified its cybersecurity workforce areas of critical need. GAO reviewed DHS's procedures and data, and interviewed DHS officials. What GAO Found The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has begun activities related to identifying, categorizing, and assigning the appropriate employment codes to its cybersecurity positions. However, DHS has not completed all of these activities, as required by the Homeland Security Cybersecurity Workforce Assessment Act of 2014 (HSCWAA). Specifically, DHS did not develop timely and complete procedures or review its components' procedures. In addition, it did not completely and reliably identify and assign employment codes because its processes were manual, undocumented, and resource-intensive. For example, DHS did not complete its update of procedures for identifying positions and assigning codes until April 2016\u201413 months after the due date. In addition, DHS did not complete any of the activities associated with establishing procedures and identifying and assigning employment codes to positions by the statutorily defined due dates, and two of these efforts are still ongoing. Without complete and accurate procedures, DHS cannot be assured that it will have an accurate understanding of its internal coding progress. DHS has not identified or reported to Congress its department-wide cybersecurity work categories and specialty areas of critical need. Specifically, DHS has not identified or reported to Congress its department-wide cybersecurity critical needs that align with the National Initiative for Cybersecurity Education (NICE) framework.

The Navy has been considering two options for CVN 65 dismantlement and disposal: the naval shipyard option and a full commercial option. GAO was asked to review the Navy's plans and decisions for CVN 65 dismantlement and disposal. This report (1) describes the differences between the dismantlement and disposal options under consideration, including cost and schedule as well as workload and facilities; (2) evaluates the Navy's funding and reporting practices for dismantlement and disposal activities; and (3) assesses the effect that nuclear regulatory authority considerations have on dismantlement and disposal options for CVN 65. GAO reviewed Navy documents and interviewed Navy officials and commercial companies. What GAO Found The Navy is weighing a number of considerations before making a decision for CVN 65 dismantlement and disposal. The naval shipyard option offers well-established processes for dismantling and disposing of the ship's nuclear material and better understood cost and schedule estimates than the full commercial option. GAO's analysis of available data, however, found that the naval shipyard option would contribute to existing workload backlogs and exacerbate facility challenges at the shipyard that could affect its work maintaining the active fleet\u2014a Navy priority. While the Navy has not defined its requirements for the full commercial option, industry does not expect to face workload or facility challenges. Navy officials also believe that the full commercial option potentially could shorten the timeline for completing the work and reduce the total cost. The Navy's approach typically used to budget for and report on ship dismantlement and disposal does not provide sufficient information to support decision makers' oversight of CVN 65\u2014a multi-year project that may require more than $1 billion to complete. GAO found the Navy is not required to provide detailed budget information or report dismantlement and disposal cost, schedule, and programmatic information to decision makers. Providing additional information through budget requests and reporting would help ensure that decision makers have sufficient information to oversee CVN 65 dismantlement and disposal activities and to support future decisions. The Navy's regulatory authority determines the rules, procedures, and oversight that will guide the dismantlement and disposal process for CVN 65. The Navy is considering three regulatory",
    "gao_GAO-18-536": "Why GAO Did This Study The federal government has enacted a number of statutory provisions aimed at streamlining the environmental review process for highway and transit projects. However, the three most recent transportation reauthorization acts include provisions intended to streamline various aspects of the environmental review process for highway and transit projects. GAO was asked to review the environmental review process for highway and transit projects. This report (1) addresses the extent to which identified streamlining provisions had an impact on the time frames for the environmental consulting and permitting processes; (2) identifies actions taken by the resource agencies to streamline their consulting and permitting reviews and identifies additional streamlining opportunities, if any; and (3) describes the actions taken by the Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ) to accelerate highway and transportation projects. GAO reviewed relevant federal statutes, regulations, and guidance; analyzed agency data; and interviewed officials from the three federal resource agencies that perform consultations and permit reviews for federally funded highway and transit projects: FWS, NMFS, and Corps. What GAO Found The three federal resource agencies GAO interviewed told GAO that some actions called for by the 18 provisions GAO identified, such as programmatic agreements, have helped streamline the environmental consulting and permitting processes for highway and transit projects. However, a lack of reliable agency data regarding permitting and consulting time frames hinders a quantitative analysis of the provisions' impact. For example, FWS and NMFS data provided by the three agencies were not sufficiently reliable for examining the impact of the streamlining provisions on the time frames for completing consultations and issuing biological opinions. Further, FWS and NMFS data, such as missing or incorrect data and inconsistent data entry practices, could impair the agencies' ability to determine whether the agencies are meeting statutory and regulatory requirements, such as the extent to which the agencies complete formal consultations and issue biological opinions within 135 days. FWS and NMFS have limited controls that would help ensure the completeness and accuracy of their data. For example, FWS and NMFS do not require their staff to enter extension data, and some staff enter extension dates but others do not. The Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ) has focused some of its efforts on furthering the goal of streamlining environmental reviews. For example, CEQ issued regulations that direct agencies, to the fullest extent possible, to integrate the NEPA process into project planning at the earliest possible time to avoid delays",

FRDAA requires agencies to establish financial and administrative controls to manage fraud risks, and requires OMB to provide guidance to agencies on how to implement FRDAA. FRDAA also requires GAO to report on agencies' progress in implementing FRDAA. This report examines (1) federal agencies' progress and challenges in implementing fraud risk management practices, including those required by FRDAA, and (2) the extent to which OMB has taken steps that complied with FRDAA requirements and that facilitated agencies' implementation of the act. GAO surveyed 93 federal executive branch entities, conducted a roundtable discussion with selected agencies, and reviewed OMB guidance and guidance. GAO also analyzed 24 CFO Act agencies' annual financial reports, and interviewed OMB staff and selected agency officials. What GAO Found The 24 Chief Financial Officers (CFO) Act agencies GAO surveyed reported on their progress implementing the Fraud Reduction and Data Analytics Act of 2015 (FRDAA), but the reporting varied in completeness and detail. FRDAA requires agencies to report on their progress implementing the act's requirements, including establishing financial and administrative controls. However, GAO's analysis of the 24 CFO Act agencies' annual financial reports found that some agencies did not report on their progress in identifying risks and vulnerabilities with respect to payroll, beneficiary payments, and other elements specified in the act. For example, 12 of the 24 CFO Act agencies did not report on payroll, 11 did not report on beneficiary payments, 5 did not report on grants, 9 did not report on large contracts, and 7 did not report on purchase and travel cards. Agencies identified challenges undertaking some fraud risk management activities required by FRDAA, according to GAO's analysis of survey and roundtable discussions with selected agency officials. Top identified challenges were generally related to staffing and resources, among other things. Some agencies identified strategies for mitigating some of these challenges. OMB has taken steps to establish guidelines and a working group for agencies, as required by FRDAA, but limited guidance and coordination hindered some agencies' implementation of the act. Specifically, OMB issued guidelines for agencies to implement FRDAA's requirement to establish controls and report on their progress and has established a FRDAA working group, but agencies indicated the need for additional",

PPACA also established requirements for HHS to disseminate findings from federally funded CER, including findings published by PCORI, and coordinate with relevant federal health programs to build data capacity for research. PPACA also established a Trust Fund to fund these CER activities by PCORI and HHS through fiscal year 2019. GAO was asked to review HHS's CER activities. This report examines (1) the extent to which PCORI has committed funds to conduct research and build data capacity, and (2) the extent to which HHS has funded its CER activities. GAO reviewed relevant laws and regulations, and interviewed officials from HHS, PCORI, and other federal entities, as well as patient advocacy organizations. GAO also reviewed HHS's obligations for its CER activities and interviewed HHS officials. What GAO Found The Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute (PCORI) committed about $1.6 billion (or 79 percent of its total award commitments of $2.0 billion) to awards for conducting Patient-Centered Outcomes Research (PCOR) and $325 million (or 16 percent) to awards for building data capacity for research. In addition, PCORI committed $93 million for engagement and workforce awards to involve stakeholders in the research process and expand the research workforce, and committed $12 million for awards to disseminate and implement its research findings. Awards for the dissemination and implementation of its research findings were limited as of the end of fiscal year 2017, as most of this research was still underway.

In fiscal years 2018 and 2019, PCORI projects to commit an additional $514 million for research awards. Most of PCORI's research projects, awarded through fiscal year 2017, were still underway. Only 53 of its 543 research projects had been completed as of the end of fiscal year 2017, in part because PCORI's research award process typically takes 2 to 6.5 years to complete, and because almost two-thirds of the funds committed for research projects were awarded in fiscal years 2015 through 2017.

DOD has used the GRF 35 times since its inception in 2007 and has not assessed the risks it assumes by using GRF forces to augment combatant commanders' forces. GAO was asked to review DOD's use of the GRF. This report examines the extent to which (1) DOD has used the GRF and assessed any risks associated with its use; and (2) GRF-assigned units are trained to meet GRF missions, both individually and as a joint force. GAO reviewed the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff GRF Execute Order (EXORD) and DOD's Joint Training Policy for the Armed Forces of the United States to identify the GRF's overall uses and the global mission scenarios it is intended to meet, as well as the operational requirements and forces assigned to meet the requirements. GAO also interviewed DOD officials to understand how DOD selects, designates, and validates forces on the GRF, and how DOD decides when to use GRF forces for either of the two intended uses of the GRF. What GAO Found The Department of Defense (DOD) has generally used the Global Response Force (GRF) to augment combatant commanders' forces and has not assessed the risk on its ability to respond as a joint force. DOD has used the GRF 35 times in support of worldwide contingencies\u2014with 32 of those uses involving individual GRF units being deployed in support of or to augment combatant commander needs. However, according to Joint Staff officials overseeing the management of the GRF across DOD, DOD has not assessed the extent to which it assumes risk associated with the potential unavailability of GRF units for a short-notice deployment as a joint force in response to a contingency, given the predominant use of the GRF as a resource for combatant commands to obtain individual units. DOD officials stated that using GRF units to augment geographic combatant command requirements leaves them unavailable for use as part of a joint force ready to respond to an unforeseen worldwide contingency.

CBP has developed ACE to automate import processing and improve targeting and security. GAO was asked to review ACE. This report examines (1) the status of CBP's efforts to implement core ACE capabilities since 2013, (2) CBP partner agencies' access to ACE and use of the system for import processing, (3) available information about any cost savings and trade enforcement benefits that have resulted from using ACE, and (4) the approach that will be used to manage ACE after core capabilities have been completed. GAO reviewed CBP documents and interviewed CBP officials and five partner agencies that have responsibilities for ACE. GAO also reviewed CBP documents and interviewed CBP officials and trade community representatives. What GAO Found CBP has implemented core Automated Commercial Environment (ACE) capabilities since 2013, but has delayed completing most of the capabilities it identified as core. CBP deployed most of the capabilities it identified as core in February 2018, but it delayed completing other capabilities by several times. CBP officials reported that the program was again in breach, and CBP subsequently moved the target date for completing remaining core capabilities to July 2017. CBP officials stated that the agency will continue to link the newly deployed post-release capabilities to collections in ACE while deciding how to proceed. All partner agencies that CBP identified as having responsibility for clearing or licensing cargo have been granted some access to ACE data. However, as GAO's case studies of five partner agencies illustrate, the extent to which these agencies use the system varies, and agencies are continuing efforts to enhance their use of ACE. For example, 4 of the 22 partner agencies that CBP identified as having responsibility for clearing or licensing cargo have established linkages between ACE and their own import data analysis systems, apply ACE data in those systems, and have completed pilots to begin or expand their use of ACE. However, the extent to which these agencies use ACE to obtain agency-specific data from importers varies, and agencies are continuing efforts to enhance their use of ACE. For example, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) have largely transitioned to using ACE for this purpose, while the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHI",

GAO was asked to review the FFM's enrollment and eligibility-verification process. This report examines the extent to which indications of potentially improper or fraudulent enrollments exist in the FFM's application, enrollment, and eligibility-verification process for plan year 2015. GAO analyzed enrollment and eligibility data for applicants enrolled from November 15, 2014, through December 31, 2015, and identified about 8.04 million applicants with an associated subsidy who effectuated enrollments in plan year 2015. GAO also reviewed relevant federal statutes, HHS regulations, and CMS policies for plan year 2015. GAO also interviewed CMS officials. What GAO Found GAO's analysis of plan year 2015 enrollment and eligibility data identified a small percentage\u2014about 1 percent\u2014of enrollments that were potentially improper or fraudulent because they had an unresolved issue related to citizenship, status as a national, or lawful presence, or to Social Security number (SSN), or were reportedly deceased. The presence of an unresolved data-matching inconsistency could indicate that an enrollment is potentially improper or fraudulent because an unresolved inconsistency indicates that the FFM could not verify information provided by the applicant. When a data-matching inconsistency is generated, HHS regulations require that the applicant provide supporting documentation generally within 90 days to resolve the inconsistency. If the applicant does not provide requested documentation within the time frame and the FFM cannot otherwise verify the information provided by the applicant, the inconsistency may be expired, which could lead to termination from coverage or a recalculation or elimination of subsidy amounts based on the trusted data source information, depending on the type of inconsistency.

GSA's central office oversees the R&A program and its 11 regional offices are responsible for managing R&A projects. GAO was asked to review GSA's R&A program. This report examines how GSA (1) collects information on R&A projects and (2) assesses the performance of R&A projects. GAO reviewed documentation on the R&A program and interviewed officials from GSA's central office and four regional offices selected based on their geographic diversity and the number of projects completed between October 2013 and August 2017. GAO also reviewed GSA's reports on R&A projects' performance and interviewed officials from GSA's central office and four regional offices. What GAO Found The General Services Administration (GSA) collects information on repair and alteration (R&A) projects electronically and is taking steps to improve the collection of small project information. GSA's central office collects information electronically on R&A projects, and it has developed numerous systems that regional officials are required to use to collect information on capital and small projects. GSA's central office first introduced ePM as a pilot project in 2009 and, to establish consistency in the information collected, issued minimum requirement guidelines for the project information to be input in the system in 2011.

The United States also provides voluntary contributions to the organizations through project-specific assistance agreements. This testimony discusses (1) the extent to which the United States contributed to the four inter-American organizations and (2) the extent to which U.S. agencies provided voluntary contributions to these organizations. This statement is based on GAO's December 2017 report, Inter-American Organizations: Voluntary Contributions Could Enhance Monitoring of Inter-American Assistance Agreements (GAO-17-322). GAO reviewed the four inter-American organizations' assessed contributions from 2014 through 2016 and interviewed U.S. agency officials. GAO also reviewed 12 selected assistance agreements from State, HHS, USAID, and USDA. What GAO Found In June 2017, GAO reported that the United States' assessed contributions constituted over 57 percent of total assessed contributions by member states to four inter-American organizations from 2014 through 2016. During this time, the annual U.S. percentages (or quotas) of these organizations' assessed contributions have remained about the same. Therefore, the actual amounts assessed to the United States generally remained the same. The United States provided voluntary contributions to the four inter-American organizations through assistance agreements. In its December 2017 report, GAO found that State, HHS, USAID, and USDA fund activities at OAS, PAHO, and IICA in the form of assistance agreements. In its December 2017 report, GAO found that State and USDA did not include all key monitoring provisions in their agreements as called for by applicable guidance. For example, USDA did not have full documentation of any of its 10 required monitoring activities, and USAID did not have full documentation of 2 of its 11 required monitoring activities (financial and performance reports). U.S. agencies could have greater assurance that the organizations are using these funds as intended if they enhanced their monitoring of their assistance agreements. For the 12 selected agreements, USDA and State did not include all key monitoring provisions in their agreements as called for by applicable guidance.

GAO was asked to review federal labs' patent licensing activities. This report examines (1) challenges federal labs face in patent licensing and steps agencies have taken to address them, and (2) the extent to which federal labs have information on processes, goals, and comparable licenses to guide establishing the financial terms in patent licenses. GAO reviewed relevant literature and interviewed officials from the Departments of Defense (DOD), Energy (DOE), and National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), and the National Institutes of Health (NIH). GAO also reviewed relevant literature and interviewed officials from the four agencies. What GAO Found Federal labs and external stakeholders have identified challenges in patent licensing, but the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) has not fully reported such challenges. Specifically, DOD, DOE, NASA, and NIH officials at the agency and lab levels, as well as external stakeholders, identified challenges in all seven areas of the patent licensing process, including identifying inventions, keeping track of inventions, and negotiating license agreements. In addition, officials and stakeholders cited challenges in one area that cuts across the entire process: prioritizing patent licensing as part of agencies' missions. In its annual reports to Congress on federal labs' performance in patent licensing activities, NIST has discussed some challenges identified by agency and lab officials and external stakeholders but has not fully reported on the range of challenges they have experienced. For example, in its fiscal year 2015 summary report, NIST reported that the federal intramural research budget has been relatively consistent over the years but not that DOD, DOE, NASA, and NIH face challenges in keeping track of inventions developed in its labs. NIST officials stated that they were generally aware of the challenges identified by agency and lab officials and external stakeholders but had not considered including such challenges to a greater degree in the summary reports to Congress. By fully reporting the range of challenges in federal patent licensing\u2014such as those outlined in this report\u2014and including that information in its annual summary reports to Congress, NIST has the opportunity to further ensure that Congress is more aware of challenges that limit agencies' efforts in patent licensing and ways for potentially addressing those challenges. Federal agencies and labs have limited information on processes, goals, and comparable",
    "gao_GAO-18-10": "Why GAO Did This Study The United States is the world's largest producer of illicit drugs, with a total of about 1.2 billion metric tons of illicit drugs consumed in fiscal year 2016. The Western Hemisphere is a key transit point for illicit drugs and is a key source of illicit drugs for the United States. ONDCP coordinates the National Drug Control Program and develops a 5-year National Drug Control Strategy, which it updates annually. GAO was asked to review U.S. counternarcotics efforts in the Western Hemisphere. This report examines (1) U.S. agencies' spending for counternarcotics efforts in the Western Hemisphere in fiscal years 2010 through 2015, (2) agencies' efforts to gather and share best practices and lessons learned from their counternarcotics efforts both domestically and internationally, and (3) mechanisms that agencies have used to address changing drug threats. GAO reviewed ONDCP documents and interviewed officials from ONDCP, the Departments of Defense (DOD), Homeland Security (DHS), Justice (DOJ), and State, and the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID). What GAO Found Of the eight U.S. agencies included in GAO's review, DOD, ICE, and the International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs (INL) tracked counternarcotics spending on a regional basis and provided data on funds obligated for counternarcotics activities in the Western Hemisphere. DOD obligated a total of more than $2.8 billion for counternarcotics activities in the Western Hemisphere for fiscal years 2010 through 2015. DOD also obligated a total of about $1.5 billion for counternarcotics activities in the Western Hemisphere for fiscal years 2010 through 2015. ICE expended a total of about $212 million for salaries and expenses of Homeland Security Investigations' (HSI) agents and analysts working on drug cases in various countries in the Western Hemisphere during fiscal years 2010 through 2015. ONDCP facilitates the sharing of best practices and lessons learned with interagency and foreign partners by including the topic on the agendas of key meetings. For example, ONDCP officials described the sharing of best practices and lessons learned with stakeholders from Canada, Mexico, and the United States at technical workshops of the North American Drug Dialogue held in March 2017.

    "gao_GAO-18-283": "Why GAO Did This Study In fiscal years 2010 through 2016, ARNG disbursed more than $1.8 billion in financial incentives to bolster its recruiting and retention efforts. In 2008, a California National Guard audit revealed that Selected Reserve Incentive Program incentives, including student loan repayments, were being improperly paid to numerous California ARNG soldiers and that some of these cases were results of fraud. In subsequent audits of California ARNG, 17,485 soldiers were identified as having received a bonus or student loan repayment in the period of 2004 through 2010 that was potentially improper and subject to recoupment. By the end of 2016, several follow-on reviews had identified improper incentive payments to more than 1,400 soldiers. These investigations and audits determined that ARNG lacked internal controls over its incentive process. GAO was asked to review ARNG's incentive program. This report examines (1) the extent to which ARNG has implemented internal controls to prevent improper payments and (2) the extent to which DOD components have the authority to waive soldiers' incentive debts and the extent to which DOD has improved the availability of documentation to adjudicate waiver cases. GAO reviewed ARNG policies and procedures, analyzed data on incentive payments, and interviewed ARNG officials. What GAO Found The Army National Guard (ARNG) has implemented internal controls to prevent improper payments, but has not planned for future significant changes that could affect its internal controls. First, ARNG has implemented the Guard Incentive Management System to manage the life cycles of contracts between ARNG and soldiers for incentives and education entitlements, including those for the Selected Reserve Incentive Program. Second, ARNG conducts periodic reviews of its incentive program. For example, in April 2017, ARNG issued the fiscal year 2017 Selected Reserve Incentive Program policy. Among other things, the policy changed the eligibility requirement for receiving an incentive payment based on soldier performance on the Army Physical Fitness Test. ARNG officials told GAO that they had implemented several recommendations that were made as part of the Army's administrative investigation of the transition in vendors managing the Reserve Component Manpower System, of which the Guard Incentive Management System is a component. However, ARNG officials told GAO that they had not demonstrated that they had learned from its past experiences by planning for significant changes to its incentive program that could affect its internal controls, such as its information systems not functioning correctly or data related to incentive contracts not being readily updated or",
    "gao_GAO-19-5": "Why GAO Did This Study DOE uses M&O contracts to carry out its mission of advancing nuclear power and supporting national security. DOE's M&O contracts are a key component of DOE's management and operating (M&O) contracts. GAO was asked to review DOE's M&O contractor performance evaluations. This report examines (1) how DOE offices evaluated M&O contractor performance in fiscal years 2006 through 2016 and the extent to which these offices have documented their evaluation approaches; (2) the extent to which DOE's fiscal year 2016 M&O contractor performance evaluation reports provide information on contractors' technical, administrative, and cost performance; and (3) the results of DOE's M&O contractor performance evaluations from fiscal years 2006 through 2016. GAO reviewed DOE policies and procedures, annual performance evaluation and measurement plans, and performance evaluation reports (PERs) for 21 of 22 DOE M&O contracts in place as of fiscal year 2016, the most recently completed contract year at the time GAO initiated its review. GAO also reviewed agency documents and interviewed DOE officials. What GAO Found The Department of Energy (DOE) offices generally used one of three different approaches to evaluate M&O contractor performance\u2014the Science and Energy Laboratory (SC), the Office of Nuclear Energy (NE), and the Office of Science (SC). All but one of these offices has documented their approaches in policies and procedures; NNSA has a broad policy but does not have procedures for implementing it, in particular for collecting and using performance information. In the absence of documented procedures, NNSA may not consistently collect and use performance information in evaluating contractor performance. GAO found that DOE's fiscal year 2016 M&O contractor performance evaluation reports provided less information on M&O contractors' cost performance than on other types of performance. Specifically, the PERs were 67 pages long on average and contained about 1 page of cost performance-related information overall. In contrast, information on contractors' technical and administrative performance included in-depth descriptions of contractors' scientific discoveries and production progress that spanned numerous pages. DOE offices' fiscal year 2016 PERs provided 94 percent of available award and incentive fees, and contractors at more than half of the 24 M&O contract rating sites received award and incentive fees equivalent to the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) rating categories of Excellent or Very Good 94 percent of the time. During this time frame, administrative performance sometimes had lower ratings\u2014though these were balanced",
    "gao_GAO-18-638": "Why GAO Did This Study USPS has a large volume of competitive products, which are a growing sector of its business. USPS expects that growth in e-commerce will increase the volume of its competitive products, especially for the last-mile delivery service to consumers. GAO was asked to review USPS's competitive products scanning. This report examines (1) the extent to which USPS's competitive products are scanned and scanned correctly, (2) the extent to which USPS has designed policies and procedures to support the accurate scanning of competitive products, and (3) the extent to which USPS has used reports to track scanning performance. GAO reviewed USPS data on competitive products and interviewed USPS officials and representatives of mailers. What GAO Found The U.S. Postal Service (USPS) reports GAO reviewed indicate that competitive products are almost always scanned and scanned correctly. USPS has an overall organizational goal of accurately scanning 100 percent of all mail pieces\u2014both competitive and other products\u2014that have a barcode. However, individual management employee-performance goals for scanning are set slightly lower than 100 percent, as USPS officials stated that they recognize that some scanning issues, such as for missing or inaccurate barcodes, may occur across post offices. For example, the USPS Office of Inspector General (OIG) analyzed approximately 2 billion delivery scans over a 6-month period in 2017 and found that 1.9 million delivery scans (about 0.1 percent) occurred at the post office instead of at the delivery address and were considered improper scans. Further, examples of USPS's internal reports GAO reviewed containing scanning performance results showed that a small percentage of competitive mail items had not been scanned. USPS has not based its operational policies and procedures, such as those that support the accurate scanning of competitive products, on any standards for internal controls. USPS officials told GAO that they have not used any specific criteria for designing, implementing, and operating an internal control system for meeting its operational policies and internal controls, such as those that help ensure competitive products are accurately scanned. Instead, USPS officials stated that USPS has designed its operational policies and internal controls over the years based on its unique responsibilities, management experience, and sound business practices. However, officials could not identify any specific standards or framework they had followed. GAO has reported that standards for the design, implementation, and operation of their internal-control system provide",
    "gao_GAO-18-319": "Why GAO Did This Study Federal agencies are increasingly acquiring space to meet their missions. GAO was asked to review the use of telework in space planning. This report addresses (1) how the 23 civilian Chief Financial Officer (CFO) Act agencies reported using telework in office space planning; (2) the specific ways selected agencies and GSA used telework in their office space planning; and (3) any challenges the 23 civilian CFO Act agencies faced in using telework in office space planning. GAO analyzed agency-wide space-planning documents, policies, and survey data; reviewed agency space-planning documents and space-planning documents from the 23 civilian CFO Act agencies; and interviewed agency officials and private sector subject matter experts. What GAO Found In reviewing planning documents, policies, and survey data, GAO found that the 23 civilian CFO Act agencies reported using telework to reduce or use space more efficiently. Specifically, GAO's analysis of (1) agency-wide space-planning policies and procedures and (2) Real Property Efficiency Plans found that all of the agencies discussed telework in the context of space planning and achieving greater space efficiencies. Agencies also provided examples in survey responses of how they have used telework to increase operational effectiveness while optimizing their use of space. Among the agencies GAO reviewed in detail\u2014the General Services Administration (GSA), the Office of Justice Programs (OJP), the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), and the Department of the Treasury\u2014the use of telework in office space planning varied from emerging consideration to extensive implementation. GSA and OJP have used telework extensively to both reduce space and increase space efficiency in their office spaces. CDC has leveraged telework to reduce space or use space more efficiently in more limited cases while the Fiscal Service has begun to consider telework in future space planning. GAO's analysis of the 23 civilian CFO Act agencies identified three major planning challenges agencies face in using telework to reduce space: human capital issues such as negotiating workspace changes with collective bargaining units and managing organizational change; the suitability of telework to mission work requirements; and difficulty measuring cost savings that might result from space reductions attributable to telework. These challenges include (1) negotiating workspace changes with collective bargaining units and managing organizational change; (2) managing change; and (3) measuring cost savings that might result from space reductions",
    "gao_GAO-18-401": "Why GAO Did This Study DOD's FMS program provides support to over 150 foreign partners, with annual sales totaling $416 billion between fiscal years 2007 and 2017. The FMS program also includes administrative fees, which are collected from foreign partners and are paid from the FMS trust fund. GAO was asked to review DOD's FMS program. This report examines (1) the balance maintained in the administrative account in fiscal years 2007 to 2017, the controls used to manage it, and the extent to which DOD has the ability to pay for FMS administrative expenses under different scenarios; and (2) the balance maintained in the contract administration services (CAS) account in fiscal years 2007 to 2017 and the controls used to manage it. GAO analyzed DOD and State data on FMS administrative and CAS fee collections and expenditures, and interviewed DOD and State officials. What GAO Found The FMS administrative account balance grew steadily over the last decade due in part to the insufficient controls the Defense Security Cooperation Agency (DSCA) has in place to manage the account balance. DSCA has set a minimum desired level for the account and has processes for regularly monitoring the account's balance. However, DSCA has not completed timely comprehensive reviews of the administrative fee rate, consistent with DSCA policy, and has not set an upper bound of a target range for the account balance. As a result, DSCA's monitoring and rate review practices are limited in their ability to prevent excessive growth in the account balance. GAO's analysis indicates that even if the administrative fee rate were reduced to as low as 2.9 percent and annual expenditures were to increase 15 percent above expected growth, the administrative account balance would likely remain sufficient to pay for projected expenditures while maintaining a reserve balance through at least fiscal year 2024. GAO's modeling shows that, even if DSCA reduced the administrative fee rate an additional 0.3 percent lower than it plans to effective June 2018, the administrative account balance would likely remain sufficient to pay for projected expenditures while maintaining a reserve balance through at least fiscal year 2024. The CAS account balance grew substantially between fiscal years 2007 and 2015 because CAS collections exceeded expenditures in each year and insufficient controls were in place to manage the balance. The account balances for fiscal years 2016 and 2017 overstate available funds due to a systems issue and limited related oversight. Since fiscal year 2014, DSCA",
    "gao_GAO-18-388": "Why GAO Did This Study The LDA requires lobbyists to register with the Secretary of the Senate and the Clerk of the House and to file quarterly disclosure reports disclosing their respective lobbying activities. The LDA also requires that GAO periodically review lobbyists' compliance with the LDA. This report examines the extent to which lobbyists are able to demonstrate compliance with the LDA by providing documentation to support information contained on registrations and reports filed under the LDA; identifies challenges and potential improvements to compliance, if any; and describes the resources and authorities available to the U.S. Attorney's Office for the District of Columbia (USAO), its role in enforcing LDA compliance, and the efforts it has made to improve LDA enforcement. GAO reviewed a stratified random sample of 98 quarterly disclosure reports filed for the third and fourth quarters of 2016 and the first and second quarters of 2017, and a stratified random sample of year-end 2016 and midyear 2017 political contributions reports (LD-203). GAO also interviewed officials from USAO and the lobbyists and lobbying firms. What GAO Found For most lobbying disclosure (LD) reports filed under the Lobbying Disclosure Act of 1995, as amended (LDA), lobbyists provided documentation for key elements of their disclosure reports. For most LD-2 reports, lobbyists provided documentation for income and expenses for sampled reports from 2010 through 2017. However, in recent years GAO's findings showed some variation in the estimated percentage of lobbyists who have reports with documentation for income and expenses supporting lobbying activities. Specifically, GAO estimates that 99 percent of lobbyists who filed LD-2 reports that provided documentation for income and expenses from 2016 to 2017 represents a statistically significant increase from 2016. For most LD-2 reports, lobbyists provided documentation for income and expenses for sampled reports from 2010 through 2017. However, in recent years GAO's findings showed some variation in the estimated percentage of lobbyists who had reports with documentation for income and expenses supporting lobbying activities. Specifically, GAO estimates that 25 percent of reports did not round their income or expenses as the guidance requires. GAO has found that rounding difficulties have been a recurring issue on LD-2 reports from 2010 through 2017. GAO also found that some lobbyists were still unclear about the need to disclose certain covered positions, such as",
    "gao_GAO-18-302": "Why GAO Did This Study The Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003 (MMA) required the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation (Innovation Center) to develop models to improve the quality of care and program spending for Medicare beneficiaries. The Innovation Center is a joint federal agency and the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) within the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). The Innovation Center is a model-testing center that is intended to test new payment and service delivery models. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act included a provision for GAO to report on the Innovation Center. This report examines the extent to which the Innovation Center (1) implemented models that tested delivery and payment approaches tested and program beneficiaries covered, and (2) used the results of model evaluations to inform the development of additional models and to make changes to implemented models. GAO reviewed relevant laws, regulations, and guidance; analyzed agency data; and interviewed agency officials. What GAO Found The Innovation Center implemented 37 models that tested delivery and payment approaches tested and program beneficiaries covered. As of March 1, 2018, the Innovation Center had implemented 37 models under section 1115A of the Social Security Act. Of those 37 models, the testing period has concluded for 10 of them. In addition, the Innovation Center announced two models to begin testing in 2018. Innovation Center models varied based on several characteristics, including delivery and payment approaches tested and program(s) covered. Delivery and payment approaches varied across all implemented and announced models\u2014even models organized by the Innovation Center under the same model category. For example, the six models that tested an episode-based payment approach varied in terms of how episodes were defined, including the clinical and surgical episodes to which models applied. In addition, some models included multiple approaches for achieving changes in health care delivery or payment. The Innovation Center obligated over $5.6 billion of the $10 billion appropriated for fiscal years 2011 through 2019 under section 1115A of the Social Security Act. The obligated amounts for individual models during this period ranged from $8.4 million to over $967 million, and varied based on model scope and design. The Innovation Center has used the results from model evaluations to generate ideas for new models. For some of the early implemented models, evaluation results showed reduced spending and maintained or improved quality of care, but also identified model design limitations that could affect those results. According to officials, in some of these instances, the Innovation Center has developed new models",
    "gao_GAO-18-344": "Why GAO Did This Study DHS is responsible for acquiring and deploying systems to support its mission. DHS uses O&S funds to support its major acquisition programs. GAO was asked to review DHS's O&S activities. This report assesses, for selected major acquisition programs, the extent that (1) DHS budget management and reporting affects operations and oversight; and (2) life-cycle cost estimates are comprehensive and accurate, as well as regularly updated. GAO reviewed DHS's budget justifications and monthly execution reports, and analyzed life-cycle cost estimates against best practices. GAO also interviewed DHS officials and selected components. What GAO Found The Department of Homeland Security's (DHS) mission-oriented budget management provides operational flexibility in using operations and maintenance (O&S) funding, but its budget justifications and reports aggregate O&S data, limiting oversight of major acquisition programs' O&S costs. DHS's mission-oriented budget management allows, to a limit, components to move funds between major acquisition programs. For example, Customs and Border Protection's Air and Marine Operations Division consolidates O&S funds within a single account, which makes them more responsive to mission changes. However, DHS's budget justifications and reports aggregate O&S data, limiting oversight of major acquisition programs' O&S costs. While some program-level O&S data are available at the component level, this information does not appear in DHS's budget reports to Congress. This disparity is due, in part, to the format of the budget reports. DHS's recent change to its congressional budget justification to include program-level O&S cost information in the procurement section is an improvement, but Congress still lacks complete information regarding DHS O&S costs as such data are absent from monthly execution reporting. Until DHS takes concrete action to reverse the exclusion of O&S funding at a major acquisition program level in its Future Years Homeland Security Program reports, Congress will lack important information necessary for oversight. The O&S portion of GAO's selected programs' most recently approved life-cycle cost estimates (LCCEs) were nearly all comprehensive, but lacked elements of accuracy despite annual and other updates. Specifically, 10 of the 11 selected programs reviewed either substantially or fully met GAO's criteria for comprehensiveness, while only 5 substantially or fully met criteria",

GAO was asked to review the territories' ability to repay public debt. This report describes (1) trends in public debt and its composition between fiscal years 2005 and 2015, (2) trends in revenue and its composition between fiscal years 2005 and 2015, (3) the major reported drivers of the territory's public debt, and (4) what is known about the ability of the territory to repay public debt. GAO analyzed fiscal year 2015 and 2016 audit reports for the territories' public audit reports, reviewed relevant laws and regulations, and interviewed officials from the territories' governments, the three rating agencies that provide credit ratings for the territories' securities, and the Department of the Interior's Office of Insular Affairs. What GAO Found Puerto Rico's total public debt increased from $39.2 billion in fiscal year 2005 to $67.8 billion at the end of fiscal year 2014, an average rate of 6.3 percent per year. Bonded debt outstanding \u2014including mainly general obligation and revenue bonds\u2014represented the majority of total public debt outstanding for all years. Bonded debt outstanding averaged 86 percent of total public debt between fiscal years 2005 and 2014, increasing from a total of $35 billion in fiscal year 2005 to $58.5 billion in fiscal year 2014. Puerto Rico's general revenue fluctuated between fiscal years 2005 and 2014, with lows around $11.6 billion between fiscal years 2008 and 2010 and again in 2013. Puerto Rico's net position for the primary government declined year over year from a negative $15.2 billion as of fiscal year end 2005 to a negative $49.7 billion as of fiscal year end 2014.

CLS Bank that using a generic computer to implement an abstract idea is not patentable. The CBM program was created in 2011 to address concerns about patent infringement litigation. GAO was asked to review the CBM program. This report (1) describes the extent to which the CBM program has been used to challenge patents, and the results of those challenges; (2) examines the extent to which USPTO ensures timeliness of trial decisions, reviews decisions for consistency, and engages with stakeholders to improve its administrative proceedings for the program; and (3) discusses stakeholder views on the effects of the CBM program and whether it should be extended past its scheduled September 2020 sunset date. GAO analyzed patent litigation data from September 2012 through September 2017, reviewed relevant laws and regulations, and interviewed officials from USPTO, the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO), and industry stakeholders. What GAO Found From September 2012 through September 2017, parties accused of patent infringement filed 524 petitions challenging the validity of 359 distinct patents under the CBM program, resulting in rulings against about one-third of these patents. The average monthly number of petitions fluctuated during this period, but use of the program has declined since 2015. Some stakeholders have expressed concern about multiple petitions being filed against the same patent, but GAO's analysis of petition data showed that the vast majority of patents challenged under the CBM program were challenged once or twice. The Patent Trial and Appeal Board has completed all trials under the America Invents Act (AIA)-authorized proceedings within statutorily directed time frames, according to board data, and the board has taken steps to review issues that could affect the consistency of its trial proceedings and decisions and to engage with stakeholders to improve its proceedings. To ensure timeliness of trial proceedings, the board provided a checklist of information and time frames to petitioners and patent owners, among other things. Board officials told GAO that the board has also taken steps to review and assess its trial proceedings and decisions, but it does not have guidance for reviewing trial decisions, or the processes that lead to the decisions, for consistency.

Congress included a provision in the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2017 for GAO to assess the solvency of each privatized military housing project in the United States and the effect of recent changes in basic allowance for housing on long-term project sustainability. This report examines the extent to which DOD (1) assessed and reported the financial condition of each privatized housing project; (2) assessed the effects of recent reductions in the basic allowance for housing on privatized housing, and identified any other challenges and options to address challenges; and (3) defined notification requirements for project changes and risk tolerances relative to privatized housing goals. GAO reviewed DOD guidance and project oversight reports, and interviewed officials from DOD and the military departments. What GAO Found The Department of Defense (DOD) regularly assesses the financial condition of its privatized housing projects through recurring internal reporting by the military departments on each of their projects; however, key data on current financial conditions are not mutually comparable. Moreover, the military departments vary in the extent to which they use measures of future sustainment needs and funding to assess project sustainability. In addition, DOD has not consistently issued required reports to Congress on the financial condition of privatized housing projects in a timely manner. Section 2884(c) of Title 10 of the United States Code requires the Secretary of Defense to report semiannually an evaluation of the status of oversight and accountability measures for military housing privatization projects, including, among other things, information about financial health and performance and the backlog of maintenance and repair. DOD provided a report covering fiscal year 2013 to Congress in November 2014, and then did not provide another report, covering fiscal year 2014, until October 2017. DOD officials stated that they have not provided the reports in a timely manner in recent years due to staff turnover and limited resources, as well as efforts to ensure the quality of the data included in the reports. An Assistant Secretary of Defense for Energy, Installations, and Environment (ASD) official stated that DOD is planning to resume timely reporting, with a consolidated report covering fiscal years 2015 and 2016 to be submitted to Congress in the second quarter of fiscal year 2018, and a report covering fiscal year 2017 to be submitted in late fiscal year 2018.

In fiscal year 2017, the federal government spent about $49 billion on improper payments. GAO was asked to review the extent to which certain federal agencies' improper payment risk assessments for selected programs provided a reasonable basis for determining susceptibility to significant improper payments. This report examines the extent to which certain federal agencies' improper payment risk assessments for selected programs provided a reasonable basis for determining susceptibility to significant improper payments. GAO reviewed relevant federal guidance and internal control standards, and interviewed agency officials. What GAO Found The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), the Department of the Treasury (Treasury), and the Department of Justice (DOJ) conducted five improper payment risk assessments for fiscal years 2015 through 2017, and GAO found that HHS's risk assessments for Head Start and Treasury's risk assessments for Interest on the Public Debt and HAMP were not sufficient to support their risk determinations. HHS's qualitative risk assessment for Head Start did not document or effectively demonstrate how each of the nine risk factors affected Head Start's susceptibility to significant improper payments. For example, HHS did not document or effectively demonstrate how each of the nine risk factors affected Head Start's susceptibility to significant improper payments. Further, HHS did not document how the descriptors or individual risk factors relate to the program's susceptibility to significant improper payments. Without supporting documentation, HHS cannot demonstrate, and GAO cannot determine, that its process for determining Head Start's susceptibility to significant improper payments was reasonable. During fiscal years 2015 through 2017, HHS did not conduct risk assessments for at least 140 of its programs and activities, as required by the Improper Payments Information Act of 2002, as amended (IPIA). Specifically, HHS did not assess at least 140 of its programs and activities during the 3-year period, as required by IPIA. Specifically, HHS did not assess its Block Grants for Prevention and Treatment of Substance Abuse program that had outlays of approximately $1.8 billion in fiscal year 2016. Treasury did not have sufficient documentation for how it developed its risk assessments, so GAO could not determine if the risk assessment process was designed to provide a reasonable basis for making risk determinations.

BLM is responsible for managing approximately 700 million acres of subsurface mineral estate throughout the country, including the acreage it leases to operators for oil and gas development. GAO was asked to review BLM's lease suspensions. This report examines (1) the process BLM uses to determine whether to suspend oil and gas leases; (2) the extent of oil and gas lease suspensions and the reasons for the suspensions of selected leases; and (3) the approach that BLM uses to monitor the status of lease suspensions and the extent to which this approach allows for oversight of such lease suspensions. GAO analyzed BLM data on oil and gas lease suspensions as of September 30, 2016, and interviewed agency officials. What GAO Found The Bureau of Land Management (BLM) uses a multistep process to determine whether to suspend oil and gas leases, and this process, according to BLM guidance and officials, typically begins with an operator submitting a request to the appropriate BLM field office. Once the request is received, the cognizant BLM field official\u2014usually a petroleum engineer at the field office\u2014reviews it for completeness and whether the reasons cited meet the suspension criteria established in federal regulations and BLM's Suspensions of Operations and/or Production Manual. These criteria require that lease suspensions be approved only in the interest of the conservation of natural resources or for circumstances beyond the operator's control. According to BLM data, about 2,750 of BLM's approximately 41,000 oil and gas leases were suspended at the end of fiscal year 2016, but the reasons for the suspensions were difficult to determine. These data indicated that as of September 2016, about 2,750 of BLM's approximately 41,000 oil and gas leases were suspended in various locations for various lengths of time. LR2000 did not always contain the reasons for suspensions, which required GAO to take additional steps to identify the reasons. For example, BLM officials said that while LR2000 does not have a field to specifically capture the reason for a suspension, the general remarks field could be used for this purpose. Because GAO found this field was rarely used to capture the reason for suspensions, GAO reviewed the official lease files for a sample of 48 leases in Montana and Wyoming that were suspended as of September 30, 2016, and interviewed",
    "gao_GAO-19-62": "Why GAO Did This Study In fiscal year 2017, the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) provided assistance to El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras, which are considered the most vulnerable migrant populations. GAO was asked to review U.S. assistance to these countries. This report examines (1) USAID's efforts to assist the reception and reintegration of migrants from El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras into their home countries since fiscal year 2014; and (2) what is known about the effectiveness of these efforts. GAO reviewed USAID's three program contribution agreements with IOM, reviewed IOM program reporting documents, and interviewed U.S. and host government officials in El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras. What GAO Found USAID has provided funding for short- and long-term assistance to migrants returning to El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras, whether they are returning from the United States or Mexico. Short-term efforts assist returning migrants arriving at reception centers in their home countries. Long-term efforts focus on reintegrating migrants into their home countries. USAID provided approximately $27 million to IOM through three program contribution agreements to conduct these efforts. These efforts are in various stages of development in all three countries. Host governments face challenges in their efforts to reintegrate migrants, including limited resources and a lack of employment opportunities. USAID assessed the effectiveness of its assistance for reintegration efforts in El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras, which have improved the capacity of the governments of El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras to provide reception services to returning migrants and to collect and utilize migration information. USAID has not yet assessed the effectiveness of reintegration efforts conducted to date, but plans to sign an agreement by the end of December 2018 for a new reintegration program which will include a monitoring and evaluation component. USAID assessed the effectiveness of its assistance for reintegration efforts through program monitoring and report reviews, which helped USAID track progress and results. USAID also assessed the effectiveness of IOM's efforts to assist returning migrants and improve migration information through site visits, meetings with IOM, and review of IOM reports. USAID has not yet assessed the effectiveness of reintegration efforts conducted to date, but plans to sign an agreement by the end of December 2018 for a new reintegration program which will include",

Three of the four at sea mishaps that have occurred\u2014two collisions and one grounding\u2014have involved ships homeported overseas in Yokosuka, Japan. This testimony discusses the Navy's efforts to (1) increase its presence and (2) rebuild readiness. This statement is based on GAO reports issued from September 2016 through May 2017, selected updates conducted in May 2017, and selected updates conducted in May 2017. For the updates, GAO analyzed Navy data on ship maintenance and maintenance availabilities completed through the end of fiscal year 2016 and updated data for fiscal years 2011 through 2017. What GAO Found Since 2006, the Navy has doubled the percentage of its surface combatants and amphibious ships assigned to overseas homeports. In 2006, 20 ships were homeported overseas (7 percent of the fleet), today, 40 ships are homeported overseas (14 percent of the fleet) in Japan, Spain, Bahrain, and Italy; and an additional destroyer will be homeported in Yokosuka, Japan in 2018. According to the Navy, homeporting ships overseas is an efficient method for providing forward presence and rapid crisis response. GAO's prior work confirms that having ships homeported overseas provides additional presence, but it comes at a cost. For example, GAO found in May 2015 that homeporting ships overseas results in higher operations and support costs than homeporting ships in the United States. In addition, the operational schedules the Navy uses for overseas-homeported ships limit dedicated training and maintenance periods, resulting in difficulty keeping crews fully trained and ships maintained. In May 2015, GAO recommended that the Navy develop and implement a sustainable operational schedule for all ships homeported overseas. DOD concurred and reported in 2015 that it had developed revised operational schedules for all ships homeported overseas. However, when GAO contacted DOD to obtain updated information for this testimony, U.S. Pacific Fleet officials stated that the revised operational schedules for the cruisers and destroyers homeported in Japan were still under review and had not been employed. In May 2015, GAO recommended that the Navy develop a comprehensive assessment of the long-term costs and risks to its fleet associated with the Navy's increasing reliance on overseas homeporting to meet presence requirements; make any necessary",

BLM inspects operators to ensure compliance with federal and Indian leases and to ensure that wells are properly plugged. GAO was asked to review BLM's Oil and Gas Inspection and Enforcement program. This report examines (1) the distribution of BLM's workload and workforce among its 33 field offices with ongoing oil and gas development activities and (2) the extent to which BLM has completed internal control reviews of its field offices. GAO analyzed BLM data on wells drilled, well plugging work months, and enforcement actions from fiscal years 2012 through 2016, and interviewed agency officials. What GAO Found In fiscal years 2012 through 2016, the distribution of the Bureau of Land Management's (BLM) Oil and Gas Inspection and Enforcement program's workload and workforce among its 33 field offices with ongoing oil and gas development activities showed an imbalance, based on GAO's analysis of BLM data. BLM took both short- and long-term actions in fiscal years 2012 through 2016 to address this imbalance, such as temporarily re-assigning inspectors from some medium activity offices to some of the highest activity offices. Based on GAO's review of BLM documentation and interviews with agency officials, two key factors affected the distribution of the program's workload: (1) energy market changes (e.g., price fluctuations) and (2) BLM actions to plan and prioritize inspection workload (e.g., changing risk classification for production inspections and decreasing the number of work months for plugging inspections). Two key factors\u2014based on GAO's review of agency documentation and interviews with agency officials\u2014affected the distribution of the program's workload: (1) energy market changes (e.g., price fluctuations) and (2) BLM actions to plan and prioritize inspection workload (e.g., changing risk classification for production inspections and decreasing the number of work months for plugging inspections). BLM changed its methodology to identify and classify risk, which led to fluctuations in the number of high-priority production inspection cases in a given fiscal year. BLM also reduced the estimated number of plugging inspection work months from about 200 in fiscal year 2012 to about 155 in fiscal year 2016, or about 23 percent. BLM field offices did not complete internal control reviews at 27 of 33 field offices, including 5 of the 6",

In 2011, federal law authorized Education to modify the terms and conditions of the Capital Financing Program for these HBCUs. GAO was asked to review the program. This report examines (1) HBCUs' capital project needs; (2) funding sources HBCUs use to address their capital project needs; and (3) the extent to which Education helps HBCUs access and successfully participate in the program. GAO analyzed Education data and documents, surveyed HBCUs, and interviewed officials from Education, HBCU organizations, and other stakeholders. What GAO Found HBCUs, stakeholders, and planning documents identified extensive and diverse capital project needs. Almost all HBCUs responding to GAO's survey (70 of 79) reported that, on average, 46 percent of their building space needed to be repaired or replaced. For example, of the 35 public HBCUs that responded to GAO's survey on building condition, 8 reported more than three-quarters of their building space is in need of repair or replacement. Like all institutions of higher education, HBCUs are facing increasing capital project needs due to aging campus facilities, according to higher education organization officials and facilities experts. HBCUs primarily rely on a few sources of funding to address capital project needs, such as state grants and appropriations for public HBCUs and private giving and tuition and fees for private HBCUs. Officials from almost half of the HBCUs GAO interviewed (7 of 15) said relying on a few funding sources can affect a college's ability to fund capital projects. Education officials and several stakeholders also said this reliance can put the HBCUs at a financial disadvantage when seeking additional external funding, such as from the bond market. Fewer than half of HBCUs, or 46 of 99 HBCUs that are eligible, have used the HBCU Capital Financing Program to fund capital projects, according to Education data. HBCUs have borrowed over $2 billion, with private HBCUs representing about two-thirds of the loan volume. Education and its designated bonding authority have taken some steps to increase awareness of the program, but some",

DOD has issued regulations for about 90 contaminants, including PFOS, PFOA, and perchlorate. Senate Report 114-255 accompanying a bill for the national defense authorization for fiscal year 2017 included a provision for GAO to review DOD's efforts to manage contaminants in drinking water. This report examines the extent to which DOD has (1) internally reported data on compliance with health-based drinking water regulations at military installations and used those data to assess compliance at its two types of public water systems and (2) taken actions to address concerns with its firefighting foam containing perfluorinated chemicals (PFCs) and to address elevated levels of perfluorooctanesulfonic acid (PFOS), perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), and perchlorate in drinking water at or near military installations. GAO analyzed DOD and EPA data for fiscal years 2013 through 2015, the most recent data available at the time of GAO's review; reviewed DOD policies and guidance; and interviewed DOD and EPA officials. What GAO Found For the years GAO reviewed\u2014fiscal years 2013 through 2015\u2014the military departments annually reported information internally to the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Energy, Installations, and Environment (ASD) on compliance with and violations of Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and state health-based drinking water regulations, which indicate that drinking water quality at DOD public water systems was similar to other systems in the United States. However, not all violations of these regulations were reported to ASD (EI&E) during this time frame, as is required by DOD policy. The military departments reported that a total of 77 military installations had at least one violation at some point during that time period: 35 in fiscal year 2013, 25 in fiscal year 2014, and 17 in fiscal year 2015. The most common types of contaminants for which the military departments reported violations were coliform and two disinfection byproduct contaminants\u2014trihalomethanes and haloacetic acids\u2014which, according to EPA, are among the most common types of contaminants for which health-based drinking water violations occur across the United States.

In January 2017, U.S. embassy and State officials began responding to incidents in Cuba that were later associated with various injuries. In June 2018, the Secretary of State noted that the precise nature of the injuries and the cause had not yet been established. GAO was asked to review the ARB process. This report examines (1) the extent to which State's ARB policy ensures that the Office responsible is made aware of incidents that may meet ARB criteria, such as those that occurred in Cuba, and (2) the extent to which State's ARB policy ensures that the Office responsible is made aware of incidents that may involve injury, loss of life, or destruction of property. GAO reviewed State's ARB policy and interviewed State officials in Washington, D.C., and Havana, Cuba. What GAO Found The Department of State's (State) Anti-Terrorism and Counterterrorism Management (ABM) policy does not ensure that the Office responsible is made aware of incidents that may involve injury, loss of life, or destruction of property. State's FAM states that the Office of the Legal Adviser (Legal), the U.S. Embassy in Havana (WHA), and the U.S. Diplomatic Service (DS)\u2014the central management analysis organization of State's Under Secretary of State for Management\u2014will initiate the ARB incident vetting process once M/PRI becomes aware of an incident that could involve loss of life, injury, or destruction of property.

GAO was asked to review GSA's design and construction of federal buildings. This report assesses the extent to which (1) GSA made design choices that affect O&M costs; (2) GSA considers O&M costs and functionality when planning and designing buildings; and (3) GSA systematically collects and shares information on O&M costs related to design choices in existing buildings. GAO analyzed GSA data on construction and O&M costs from 2000 to 2016 and interviewed GSA officials and building tenants. GAO also conducted a web-based survey of GSA building managers responsible for overseeing O&M for all 78 Design Excellence buildings. What GAO Found The General Services Administration (GSA) made design choices that affect operations and maintenance (O&M) costs in some Design Excellence buildings, such as increasing natural light and incorporating durable and easily maintained materials and finishes. For example, the First Street Federal Courthouse (Los Angeles, California) has a light well and part of its atrium that maximizes natural light. Building managers reported that the design of these buildings, such as multistory atriums and custom windows, increased O&M costs compared to an average GSA building without those features. Almost all Design Excellence building managers (76 out of 78) reported that certain design choices resulted in increased O&M costs that would not have occurred had that design choice not been selected. For example, 67 out of 78 building managers reported that the effect of including multistory open spaces, like atriums, increased O&M costs due to the challenges associated with heating and cooling, making needed repairs, and cleaning these spaces.

In July 2017, GAO reported that DLA's internal controls did not provide reasonable assurance in preventing fraud. This statement discusses (1) the uses and benefits of DOD excess controlled property for law enforcement activities, (2) DLA's actions to address previously identified weaknesses in its processes for transferring and monitoring its excess controlled property, and (3) the extent to which DLA has taken steps to address identified deficiencies in the LESO program. This statement is based on GAO's July 2017 report, Law Enforcement: DLA's Internal Controls Provide Reasonable assurance in preventing Fraud (GAO-07-295) and selected updates conducted in March 2017 on DLA's actions to address identified deficiencies in the LESO program. GAO reviewed relevant laws, regulations, and guidance; surveyed federal, state, and local law enforcement agencies; and interviewed DLA officials. What GAO Found Federal law enforcement agencies and state coordinators in GAO's survey\u2014as well as officials GAO interviewed from federal, state, and local law enforcement agencies\u2014reported various uses of DOD excess controlled property for law enforcement activities. The reported uses included enhancing counterdrug, counterterrorism, and border-security activities. Also, law enforcement agencies reported using DOD's excess controlled property for other law enforcement activities, such as search and rescue, natural disaster response, surveillance, reaching barricaded suspects, police training, and the serving of warrants. DLA has taken some steps to address previously identified weaknesses in its processes for transferring and monitoring its excess controlled property through revisions to its policy and procedures on the management, oversight, and accountability of the LESO program. Such revisions were made, in part, because of recommendations made by the Department of Defense and DLA Offices of Inspector General. In July 2017, GAO found the department had taken the following actions to enhance its transfer process through revisions to its policy and procedures: transitioned full management responsibility of the LESO program to DLA Disposition Services in 2009; developed LESO Program Standard Operating Procedures in 2012 and updated them in 2013; transitioned to a new data system in 2013 after identifying that the old system was not capable of post-",

TSA's TSOs inspect individuals and property to deter and prevent passengers from bringing prohibited items on board an aircraft or into the airport sterile area. TSA established the TSO Basic Training program at the TSA Academy in 2016 to help ensure a consistent and standardized training experience and promote enhanced camaraderie and esprit de corps. GAO was asked to review TSA's TSO Basic Training program. This report examines (1) the extent to which TSA established the TSO Basic Training program at the Academy and the potential benefits of the program, and (2) factors considered in updating the TSO Basic Training curriculum. GAO reviewed TSA documents and interviewed TSA officials. GAO also reviewed TSA's business case and training evaluation guidance. What GAO Found The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) established the Transportation Security Officer (TSO) Basic Training program at the TSA Academy in 2016 to obtain benefits from centralized training. According to TSA's business case, a centralized training academy would have a number of potential benefits relative to the decentralized training previously administered at field airports through the New Hire Training Program. Among the potential efficiencies and improvements cited by TSA are: (1) increased consistency and standardization. According to TSA documents and training officials, centralized training provides a standardized curriculum that serves as a foundation for the skills, knowledge, and equipment used across an array of different airport environments. (2) dedicated faculty and instructor development. TSA officials told GAO that centralized training will not only provide trainees with an increased focus on the TSA mission and operational environment, but can serve to instill a common culture and sense of belonging among the broader community of TSOs nationwide. (3) OTD uses information from TSA's Office of Screening Operations (OSO) to update the TSO Basic Training curriculum to address evolving security threats. OTD gathers input from TSO Basic Training participants, instructors, and contractors on ways to update the curriculum. For example, TSA instructors submit \"white paper proposals\" to TSO Basic Training course managers detailing their suggested changes to the curriculum.

FITARA requires agencies to identify IT contracts and how much is invested in them. GAO was asked to review IT acquisitions. This report examines the extent to which (1) federal agencies identify IT contracts and how much is invested in them, and (2) federal agency Chief Information Officers (CIO) are reviewing and approving IT acquisitions. GAO reviewed FITARA and OMB guidance and 96 randomly selected IT contracts at 10 agencies, selected based on the amount of IT-related obligations and the amount of IT-related product and service codes. GAO also interviewed agency officials. What GAO Found The 22 selected agencies identified 78,249 information technology (IT)-related contracts, to which they obligated approximately $14.7 billion in fiscal year 2016. Of that amount, approximately $14 billion was categorized as IT-related, consistent with the Category Management Leadership Council's product and service codes, and approximately $626 million was categorized under other, non-IT codes. The $626 million in obligations with non-IT codes could contain embedded IT or be associated with IT programs. For example, the agencies reported IT-related acquisitions categorized under such non-IT codes as IT/telecommunications training, data analysis, and research and development. However, in addition to the obligations that agencies reported to GAO, GAO identified 31,493 additional contracts at 21 agencies with IT-related product and service codes. The associated agencies obligated approximately $4.5 billion to these contracts, raising the total amount obligated to IT contracts in fiscal year 2016 to at least approximately $19.2 billion. Until agencies involve the acquisition office in their IT identification processes, and establish and effectively implement supporting guidance, they will likely not be able to ensure that all IT acquisitions are identified. OMB's and the Office of Management and Budget's (OMB) associated implementation guidance require major civilian agency chief information officers (CIO) to review and approve acquisitions of IT either directly, or through the agency's governance processes. In particular, OMB's guidance states that agencies shall not approve any acquisition plan or strategy that includes IT without the CIO's review and approval.

This statement discusses (1) SSA's approach for identifying and identifying CAL conditions, (2) SSA's procedures for identifying claims for expedited CAL processing, and (3) steps SSA has taken to ensure the accuracy and consistency of decisions on CAL claims. This statement is based on GAO's August 2017 report, Disability Insurance: SSA Has Taken Steps to Ensure Accurate and Consistent Decisions on CAL Claims, but Does Not Regularly Update Condition Descriptions or Leverage Data (GAO-17-92). GAO reviewed SSA data on claims processed in fiscal year 2016 and reviewed SSA data on claims allowed and denied for CAL claims. GAO also interviewed SSA officials and representatives from advocacy organizations, medical experts, and other stakeholders. What GAO Found The Social Security Administration (SSA) has in recent years relied on advocates for individuals with certain diseases and disorders to bring potential CAL conditions to its attention. However, SSA has not clearly communicated this or provided guidance on how to make suggestions through its CAL webpage, which communicates information to the public. Without more explicit instructions, GAO noted that advocates may not present information that is relevant for SSA's decision-making or that most strongly makes the case for these conditions to be included on the CAL list. Federal internal control standards state that agencies should use quality information to achieve their objectives. GAO concluded that absent clear guidance to advocates on how to make suggestions through its CAL webpage, SSA is missing an opportunity to gather quality information to inform its selection of CAL conditions. In addition, GAO found that relying on advocates to bring conditions to SSA's attention also introduces potential bias toward certain conditions and the possibility of missing others. Some conditions that are potentially deserving of CAL consideration may not have advocacy organizations affiliated with them, and some advocates may be unaware of CAL. As a result, some conditions may have a better chance of being considered than other, equally deserving ones that are not proposed, and individuals with those",

TSA has spent billions of dollars on a range of aviation security programs with the goal of detecting, disrupting, and deterring threats. GAO was asked to review TSA's passenger aviation security countermeasures. This report examines (1) the extent to which TSA has information on the effectiveness of selected countermeasures in detecting and disrupting threats to aviation security during fiscal year 2015, and (2) the extent to which TSA systematically evaluates the potential cost and effectiveness tradeoffs across aviation security countermeasures. GAO analyzed fiscal year 2015 data on the effectiveness of selected countermeasures\u2014passenger prescreening, checkpoint screening, checked baggage screening, explosives detection canines, and the Behavior Detection and Analysis (BDA) program\u2014and interviewed TSA officials. What GAO Found The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) has information on the effectiveness of selected aviation security countermeasures in detecting or disrupting threats to aviation security, but does not measure the effectiveness of any of these countermeasures. For example, TSA assessed the effectiveness of its passenger prescreening countermeasure in detecting passengers that may pose a threat to aviation security by measuring the percentage of airline passenger records vetted through its Secure Flight system and the number of high-risk passengers identified. In contrast, TSA assessed the effectiveness of its canine program in detecting and disrupting potential security threats by measuring canine-handler team performance during their annual certification tests as well as covert scenario-based tests called short notice assessments (SNA). Some of the effectiveness data TSA has for fiscal year 2015 are of limited reliability and TSA is taking steps to improve this information. For example, GAO reported in September 2016 that checkpoint and checked baggage screening effectiveness data from TSA's Aviation Screening Assessment Program (ASAP) were not reliable. Specifically, TSA found that TSA's FY2015 ASAP pass rates likely showed a higher level of TSO performance in screening for prohibited items than was actually the case. In response to this issue, and to provide ongoing quality assurance for field-based covert testing results, in April 2016, TSA began deploying headquarters-based covert testing teams in both the checkpoint and checked baggage screening environments",

The United States has a long history of polar icebreakers and has a long history of polar icebreaker programs. However, the Arctic is also a key polar icebreaker region. The National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2018 included a provision for GAO to review the Arctic. This report examines (1) the extent to which the Navy's June 2018 report aligns with DOD's assessments of Arctic threat levels and capabilities required to execute its 2016 DOD Arctic Strategy, and (2) the extent to which the Navy has a capability requirement for ice-hardening existing vessels or for the construction of new vessels and is evaluating Arctic-related capabilities using the established DOD process. GAO reviewed DOD and Navy documents and interviewed officials from DOD, U.S. Northern Command, Navy, and Coast Guard. What GAO Found The Navy's June 2018 report aligns with the Department of Defense's (DOD) assessments that the Arctic threat level remains low and that DOD has the capabilities required to execute its 2016 DOD Arctic Strategy. Specifically, the June 2018 report and the information it provides for each of the reporting elements discusses how the department can execute the 2016 DOD Arctic Strategy.

    "gao_GAO-18-566T": "Why GAO Did This Study The federal government plans to invest more than $96 billion for information technology (IT) in fiscal year 2018. Despite such large IT expenditures, GAO has previously reported that investments in federal IT too often result in failed projects that incur cost overruns and schedule slippages, while contributing little to the desired mission-related outcomes. In addition, security deficiencies can threaten systems once they become operational. Congress and the President have enacted various key pieces of reform legislation to address IT management issues. These include the federal IT acquisition reform legislation commonly referred to as the Federal Information Technology Acquisition Reform Act (FITARA). This legislation was intended to improve covered agencies' acquisitions of IT and enable Congress to monitor agencies' progress and hold them accountable for reducing duplication and achieving cost savings. The law includes specific requirements related to seven areas: agency Chief Information Officer (CIO) authority enhancements. CIOs at covered agencies have the authority to, among other things, (1) approve the IT budget requests of their respective agencies and (2) review and approve IT contracts. In June 2015, OMB released guidance describing how agencies are to implement FITARA. This guidance is intended to, among other things, assist agencies in aligning their IT resources with statutory establish government-wide IT management controls to meet the law's requirements, while providing agencies with flexibility to adapt to unique agency processes and requirements. In addition, in February 2018, OMB issued guidance for agencies to implement the Modernizing Government Technology (MGT) Act. The law, known as the Modernizing Government Technology (MGT) Act, authorizes agencies to establish working capital funds for use in transitioning from legacy IT systems, as well as for addressing evolving threats to information security. In addition, in May 2017, the President signed Executive Order 13800, Strengthening the Cybersecurity of Federal Networks and Critical Infrastructure. This executive order outlined actions to enhance cybersecurity across federal agencies and critical infrastructure to improve the nation's cyber posture and capabilities against cyber security threats. In February 2017, GAO reported that agencies still needed to complete significant work related to the management of IT acquisitions and operations. GAO stressed that OMB and federal agencies should continue to expeditiously implement FITARA and OMB's related guidance, which include enhancing CIO authority, consolidating data centers, and acquiring and managing software licenses.

    "gao_GAO-18-309": "Why GAO Did This Study Indians face challenges in obtaining safe drinking water and wastewater disposal. GAO was asked to review federal assistance to Indian tribes for drinking water and wastewater infrastructure. This report examines the extent to which (1) Indian tribes identified their drinking water and wastewater infrastructure needs; (2) federal agencies funded tribal drinking water and wastewater infrastructure projects, including projects to address the most severe sanitation deficiencies; and (3) the federal agencies collaborated to meet Indian tribes' drinking water and wastewater infrastructure needs. GAO reviewed IHS and EPA data on tribal drinking water and wastewater infrastructure needs and interviewed IHS and EPA officials. GAO also surveyed the seven federal agencies that administer programs to provide drinking water and wastewater infrastructure assistance to Indian tribes. What GAO Found The Indian Health Service (IHS) and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) estimated costs for tribal drinking water and wastewater infrastructure needs in fiscal year 2016, but the needs are underestimated. IHS and EPA estimated that, in fiscal year 2016, about $3.2 billion in estimated costs for infrastructure projects to address existing tribal drinking water and wastewater infrastructure needs. However, IHS's estimate of existing needs is likely too low because IHS has not identified all eligible Indian homes that may have existing sanitation deficiencies. For example, according to IHS officials, about 406,000 Indian homes in the Sanitation Deficiency System (SDS) do not have existing sanitation deficiencies. In addition, some homes' deficiency levels in HITS are inaccurate. For example, IHS officials stated that they had not assessed about 90,700 homes with a deficiency level of 0 because they had not been included in a project in the SDS. By implementing a mechanism to indicate in HITS whether each home with a deficiency level of 0 has been assessed, IHS could have more efficient ways to take steps to address the deficiencies of the homes contained in HITS. In fiscal year 2016, federal agencies obligated approximately $370 million for tribal drinking water and wastewater infrastructure projects.

SEC has a role in reviewing companies' disclosures. In April 2016, SEC published a Concept Release to seek public input on climate-related disclosures. GAO was asked to review SEC's climate-related disclosures. This report examines (1) steps SEC has taken to help companies understand disclosure requirements for climate-related risks, (2) steps SEC has taken to examine changes in climate-related disclosures since the release of its 2010 Commission Guidance Regarding Disclosure Related to Climate Change (hereafter referred to as the 2010 Guidance), and (3) constraints SEC faces when reviewing climate-related disclosures and stakeholders' views of those disclosures. GAO reviewed SEC documents and interviewed SEC staff and representatives from five industries\u2014oil and gas, mining, insurance, electric and gas utilities, and food and beverage\u2014that were identified by SEC staff as more likely than other industries to be affected by climate change-related matters due to the nature of their operations. What GAO Found The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) issued its 2010 Commission Guidance Regarding Disclosure Related to Climate Change (the 2010 Guidance) in April 2016 to clarify its existing disclosure requirements as they apply to climate-related matters. SEC staff said the issuance of the 2010 Guidance was the primary form of communication it used to clarify to companies their climate-related disclosure requirements. However, SEC staff also noted that companies should consider the 2010 Guidance along with all other guidance and securities laws and regulations applicable to their filings. SEC staff examined climate-related disclosures of a total of 60 companies in six industries each year in 2012 and 2014. In both reports, SEC staff focused on the business description, risk factors, and management's discussion and analysis sections of companies' filings and found that most of the filings included some level of climate-related disclosure in one or more of these areas. SEC staff also found that the disclosures they reviewed varied in the level of details provided. Additionally, in the 2012 report, SEC staff reported that they did not find any notable year-to-year changes in the disclosures reviewed from the year before the 2010 Guidance to the year after. SEC faces constraints in reviewing climate-related disclosures as it primarily relies on information companies determine",

The Trust Fund's debt is primarily owed to the Department of the Treasury's general fund. In fiscal year 2017, the Trust Fund's total debt was about $4.3 billion. GAO was asked to examine the Trust Fund's future financial position. This report examines the extent to which (1) the Trust Fund's debt may change through 2050 and (2) selected options could improve its future financial position. GAO simulated the effects of the scheduled 2019 coal tax rate decrease on Trust Fund finances through 2050, and simulated the effects of various options including adjusting the coal tax, forgiving interest, and forgiving debt. GAO also simulated the effects of various options including adjusting the coal tax, forgiving interest, and forgiving debt. GAO simulated the effects of various options including adjusting the coal tax, forgiving interest, and forgiving debt. GAO also simulated the effects of various options including adjusting the coal tax, forgiving interest, and forgiving debt. GAO provided a draft of this report to the Departments of Labor (DOL), Treasury, and Health and Human Services (HHS) for review and comment. DOL, Treasury, and HHS provided technical comments, which GAO incorporated as appropriate. What GAO Found Multiple factors have challenged Trust Fund finances since it was established about 40 years ago. Combined black lung benefit payments and program administrative costs exceeded Trust Fund revenue every year for the program's first decade (fiscal years 1979 through 1989), resulting in the accrual of debt. During the Trust Fund's first three fiscal years in particular, revenue covered less than 40 percent of the Trust Fund's combined benefit payments and administrative costs. As a result, the Trust Fund borrowed from Treasury's general fund to cover the annual differences between its expenditures and revenues, and by fiscal year 1989 the Trust Fund's outstanding debt to Treasury's general fund exceeded $3 billion. In 2008, the Economic Innovation Act included provisions that were expected to eliminate the Trust Fund's debt. Specifically, EIEA generally extended the coal tax rates at their current rates until December 31, 2018 (after which they are scheduled to decrease to their original levels of $0.50 per ton of underground-mined coal, and $0.",

The program is fragmented because oversight responsibility is split between CDC and APHIS. GAO was asked to review the program. This report examines the extent to which (1) the program meets key elements of effective oversight and (2) selected countries and regulatory sectors promote effective oversight. GAO reviewed program documents and interviewed program officials and laboratory representatives from CDC and APHIS, as well as representatives from selected countries and regulatory sectors. What GAO Found The Select Agent Program does not fully meet key elements of effective oversight. The program is not independent from all laboratories it oversees, and it has not formally assessed the potential risks posed by its current structure. In addition, the program regularly performs reviews of laboratories' compliance with regulatory and program requirements, but these reviews may not target the activities that pose the highest risk to biological safety and security. Moreover, even though the program has taken steps to hire additional staff and enhance the technical expertise of its staff, workforce and training gaps remain. The program has increased transparency since 2016, but the information it shares is limited and there is no consensus about what additional information could be shared, given security concerns. Lastly, the Select Agent Program has authority to enforce compliance with program requirements, but is still working to address past concerns about the need for greater consistency and clarity in actions it takes in exercising this authority.",

GAO was asked to review DOD's policies and organizations. This report examines the extent to which (1) DOD has policies and organizations in place to manage the sustainment of operational system software for weapon systems; (2) DOD and the military departments track costs to sustain weapon system software; and (3) DOD has addressed challenges securing necessary data rights to sustain weapon system software. GAO reviewed DOD policies and organizations, compared DOD and military department policies and procedures against DOD policy and statute, and interviewed officials at DOD software centers and DOD depots. What GAO Found The Department of Defense (DOD) has policies and organizations in place within weapon system management and depot maintenance to manage the sustainment of operational system software. DOD has defined software sustainment and software maintenance activities synonymously, and it defines these functions as part of depot maintenance and the core logistics capabilities determination process. DOD policy defines software sustainment and software maintenance activities synonymously, and it defines these functions as part of depot maintenance. However, the Navy does not categorize and report software sustainment as part of depot maintenance. Without the Navy's categorizing and reporting of its software sustainment costs, in accordance with DOD policy on the Depot Maintenance Core Capabilities Determination Process, DOD and Congress are not fully informed of the magnitude and cost of core software sustainment capability requirements for the Navy. As such, DOD is impeded in its efforts to plan for a ready and controlled source of technical competence, and to budget resources in peacetime while preserving the surge capabilities necessary to fully support strategic and contingency needs. Limitations in DOD's and the military departments' data reporting systems impede DOD's ability to track weapon system software sustainment costs. DOD's ability to track weapon system software sustainment costs is impeded by limitations in the collection of software data by both the Office of Cost Assessment and Program Evaluation and the military departments.

Officials from all six of these states described operating reemployment programs that connect many UI claimants to the state's public workforce system. Officials in all six of these states said they served UI claimants identified as most likely to exhaust their benefits through their primary reemployment programs, but some select additional claimants for these programs as well.

GAO has previously reported that NASA's IT management and governance structure has been ineffective and inefficient. The National Aeronautics and Space Administration Transition Authorization Act of 2017 included a provision for GAO to review the effectiveness of NASA's approach to overseeing and managing IT. This report addresses the extent to which NASA has established and implemented leading IT management practices for strategic planning, workforce planning, governance, and cybersecurity. GAO compared NASA's IT management policies, procedures, and other documentation to criteria established by federal laws and leading practices. GAO also reviewed NASA's IT management practices at two of the agency's nine centers and one mission directorate. What GAO Found The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) has not yet effectively established and implemented leading information technology (IT) management practices for strategic planning, workforce planning, governance, and cybersecurity. Specifically, NASA's IT strategic planning process is not yet fully documented and its IT strategic plan lacks key elements called for by leading practices. NASA has taken steps to improve its IT strategic plan, but the updated plan is not comprehensive in that it does not fully address all four elements of a comprehensive and effective plan.

DOD's MWR programs are divided into three distinct categories, two of which also have specific funding targets. DOD's 2016 report to Congress on appropriated funding support for MWR programs states that the funding targets are intended to ensure that the services adequately fund MWR programs instead of requiring the servicemembers and their families to pay out of their own pockets for costs that should be borne by appropriated funding. GAO was asked to review DOD's MWR programs. This report examines the extent to which the services (1) met funding targets for MWR programs in fiscal years 2012 through 2017 and (2) established an oversight structure and performance measures for MWR programs. GAO reviewed DOD's MWR program budget, funding, and accounting processes and interviewed DOD and service officials. What GAO Found The Department of Defense's (DOD) Military Morale, Welfare, and Recreation (MWR) programs generally met one of two funding targets for fiscal years 2012 through 2017 for MWR Category A mission-sustaining programs, but did not consistently meet the target for Category B programs that provide community support systems to servicemembers and their families during the same time period. Service officials said they are taking steps to meet the target, such as restoring targeted levels of appropriated funding support in future budget planning. However, DOD has not comprehensively evaluated the funding targets, which were established more than 20 years ago, to ensure they are appropriate. Standards for Internal Control in the Federal Government recommends management periodically review policies and procedures for continued relevance and effectiveness in achieving an entity's objectives.

RHS has offered options to help preserve properties with maturing mortgages, such as extending loan terms and extending the availability of rental assistance to properties. GAO was asked to review RHS's efforts to preserve properties with maturing mortgages. This report examines RHS's efforts to (1) estimate the dates that properties may exit the rural rental housing program due to mortgage maturity, and (2) preserve the affordability of rural rental properties with maturing mortgages. GAO analyzed RHS data on mortgage maturity and property exit dates and interviewed agency officials and stakeholders. What GAO Found The Rural Housing Service (RHS) developed a tool in March 2016 to estimate the number of mortgages that will mature between 2017 and 2028. RHS officials said the tool is intended to help support the agency's preservation efforts. As of April 2018, RHS had estimated property exit data available from 2017 to 2050, but not information on properties whose mortgages may mature in 2051 or beyond. RHS officials said that data will be released publically on its website when available. RHS officials said that the preservation tool and the underlying data it uses are publicly accessible via the Internet and are intended to help support the agency's preservation efforts. However, RHS officials said that the preservation tool was not designed to estimate the expected maturity of rural rental housing mortgages. As a result, RHS did not create controls intended to ensure the accuracy of data related to mortgage maturity and did not prioritize establishing a process to check that data. Without controls to help ensure that RHS, industry stakeholders, and the public have the most recent data available, they might not have the most current information that could be used for estimating property exit dates and starting preservation. RHS has taken steps to address properties with maturing mortgages, such as identifying various options and incentives intended to preserve the affordability of properties for low-income tenants. However, a majority of properties with maturing mortgages from 2014 to 2017 have exited RHS's rural rental housing program. Moreover, RHS has not taken important steps to comprehensively plan and prepare for the much larger number of potential property exits in future years, such as developing goals and metrics to assess the effectiveness of its preservation efforts and analyzing risks to its ability to preserve properties. While taking these steps would help RHS's preservation efforts",

VA contracts with state agencies to help provide this school oversight. In fiscal year 2017, there were about 14,460 schools receiving VA education benefits for about 750,000 veterans and their beneficiaries across the country. GAO was asked to review VA's oversight of schools receiving VA education benefits. This report examines (1) the impact of limited funding on state agencies' ability to fulfill their oversight responsibilities, and (2) how VA and state agencies select schools for review and how VA and state agencies coordinate oversight activities. GAO reviewed relevant laws, regulations, and VA documents; interviewed VA and state agency officials; and reviewed relevant federal laws and regulations. What GAO Found For over a decade, funding provided by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) to state agencies remained at the same level of $19 million. In fiscal year 2018, VA allocated $21 million for state agencies\u2014the first increase in funds allocated to states since fiscal year 2006. VA recently changed its method of allocating funding to state agencies. VA officials told GAO this new method was a significant improvement over the previous method they used, which was very limited. For example, VA officials said the prior funding method did not estimate how long it took state agencies to perform certain oversight activities. The officials said this limitation was a key reason they decided to develop a new funding method. VA officials said the new method is based on their work requirements, i.e., their school oversight activities and the amount of time needed to complete them. The new funding method factors in, among other things, the number of staff needed to complete a state's workload in overseeing schools; national salary averages ($80,000 for professional and $50,000 for support staff), including benefits; a national travel allowance based on the number of professional staff required to complete work requirements; the number of schools receiving VA education benefits in the state; and the estimated time needed to review different school types, the type of review (such as approvals vs. compliance surveys), and the number of student veterans enrolled. VA officials said they are aware of the concerns that NASAA and state agencies have raised about its new funding method and are aware that the analysis to develop these estimates should have more accurately factored in the time needed to approve and review different types of schools and education programs.

In June 2015 and June 2016, GAO reported that DOJ had taken steps to reduce the prison population by pursuing initiatives to: use alternatives to incarceration for low-level nonviolent crimes; prioritize prosecutions to focus on serious cases; and commute, or reduce, sentences of qualified federal inmates. In these reports, GAO highlighted potential areas for continued oversight and made six recommendations to DOJ. As of December 2017, DOJ has implemented two of the six recommendations and had not fully addressed the remaining four. This statement is based on GAO reports issued from February 2012 through June 2017, selected updates conducted in December 2017, and selected updates conducted in February and March 2017. For the updates, GAO reviewed relevant laws and regulations, interviewed DOJ officials, and interviewed selected stakeholders, including judges, victims of crime, and states. What GAO Found As of December 2017, there were a total of about 184,000 federal inmates, according to the Bureau of Prisons (BOP). As of December 2017, there were a total of about 184,000 federal inmates, according to BOP. According to BOP data, 83 percent of these inmates are in the 122 institutions managed by BOP. The remainder are confined in secure privately managed or community-based facilities, local jails, or in home confinement. BOP has a role to help ensure that offenders properly transition into society and avoid a return to prison or criminal behavior (recidivism) after they have completed their terms of incarceration. Among other activities, BOP provides reentry services to inmates within federal prisons that may include drug treatment programs, education and vocational training, and psychology services. BOP also is to facilitate the transfer of inmates into residential reentry centers (RRC), which provide assistance as inmates transition into communities, to include home confinement. RRCs provide employment counseling and job placement assistance, financial management assistance, and substance abuse treatment or counseling as well as other services, which may vary by facility. Federal collateral consequences can be contained in federal and state laws and regulations.

    "gao_GAO-18-72": "Why GAO Did This Study The ISC requires agencies to assess physical security at federal facilities. The ISC Standard also requires agencies to document decisions that deviate from the ISC Standard. GAO was asked to review the ISC's risk management standard. This report examines (1) how selected agencies' assessment methodologies align with the ISC Standard and (2) what management challenges, if any, selected agencies reported facing in conducting physical security assessments and monitoring the results. GAO reviewed ISC standards and policies and interviewed agency officials. GAO also visited 13 selected facilities and interviewed facility staff. What GAO Found None of the four selected agencies' assessment methodologies fully aligned with the Interagency Security Committee's (ISC) risk management standard for identifying necessary countermeasures. The ISC gives agencies some flexibility to design their own security-assessment methodologies for identifying necessary countermeasures as long as the chosen methodology adheres to fundamental principles of a sound risk-management methodology. Specifically, methodologies must: consider all of the undesirable events identified in the ISC Standard as possible risks to federal facilities, and assess three factors of risk (threats, vulnerabilities, and consequences) for each of the events. Furthermore, the ISC Standard requires executive departments and agencies to document decisions that deviate from the ISC Standard. At the time of GAO's review, the Department of Homeland Security's Customs and Border Protection (CBP) methodology did not fully align with the ISC Standard because it did not consider all of the undesirable events nor assess threat and consequence. CBP officials told GAO that as of January 2017, they began using an improved methodology to assess the threats, vulnerabilities, and consequences for 30 of 33 undesirable events\u2014omitting three now identified in the November 2016 revision to the ISC Standard. However, CBP has not yet updated its handbook to align with the ISC Standard, even though it started this effort over 3 years ago. Without updated policies and procedures requiring a methodology that fully aligns with the ISC Standard, CBP cannot reasonably ensure that its facilities will have levels of protection commensurate to their risk. Without updated policies and procedures requiring a methodology that fully aligns with the ISC Standard, agencies may not collect the information needed to assess risk and determine priorities for improved security.

GAO has previously reported that the federal government faces challenges acquiring and assigning talent, and that the federal government faces a range of challenges acquiring and assigning talent. GAO was asked to review federal workforce management. This report (1) identifies key trends affecting federal work and workers, and (2) key talent management strategies agencies can employ to achieve a high-performing federal workforce, given those trends. GAO analyzed federal employee and management data from OPM and other sources, and interviewed human capital experts and federal employee and management groups. GAO also interviewed representatives from private organizations and foreign governments. What GAO Found GAO identified key trends in agency operations and attitudes toward work that are affecting how federal work is done and, consequently, the skills and competencies that workers need to accomplish agency missions. These trends will require a federal workforce that can better adapt to and leverage constantly evolving technology and mission requirements. They will also require a federal workforce that can effectively collaborate and partner with workers both within and outside of the federal sector to achieve national policy objectives. Changing demographics and shifting attitudes towards work may require new skills to manage a diverse workforce that seeks purpose, autonomy, and career mobility. GAO identified actionable strategies that agencies may be able to use to effectively manage the future federal workforce in key talent management areas. These strategies are not an exhaustive list, collectively they suggest basic steps that agencies can take within existing authorities to position themselves to meet their talent needs. Since, in some cases, agencies already use these strategies, focused attention to leadership, culture, and sound management practices can help agencies prepare for the future workforce. For each strategy, GAO highlights some of the challenges agencies face, actions OPM can take to implement open, related recommendations from prior work, and practices that may help agencies implement the strategy. These practices are based on GAO's review of related reports, group interviews with federal Chief Human Capital Officers (CHCO), and interviews with selected private organizations and foreign governments. For example, GAO found that Australian agencies incorporated more relevant assessment methods and shared hiring lists. In addition, GAO found that federal employees who telework were more likely to be satisfied with their pay and benefits than",

WMATA's capital investments are funded through multiple sources, including grants from the federal government and state and local jurisdictions. GAO was asked to review WMATA's capital spending. This report examines (1) how WMATA expended its capital funding from fiscal years 2011 through 2017; (2) how WMATA's new capital planning process addresses weaknesses it identified in the previous process; and (3) WMATA's progress toward its track preventive maintenance goals and how the program aligns with leading program management practices. GAO reviewed relevant federal statutes and regulations, WMATA and FTA policies and documents, and a non-generalizable sample of five similar U.S. transit agencies based on geographic diversity and transit route mileage, system use, capital spending, system age, and rail fleet age. GAO also interviewed WMATA officials and reviewed WMATA and FTA documents. What GAO Found The Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority (WMATA) expended approximately $5.9 billion in capital funds from fiscal years 2011 through 2017, and expects future expenditures to increase to address state-of-good-repair needs. WMATA expended the largest portion of its capital funds on its rail and bus fleets, which include replacing, expanding, and rehabilitating its rail fleet and its bus fleet. WMATA attributed the increased expenditures to intensified efforts to address deferred maintenance, primarily through the SafeTrack initiative and an increased delivery and acceptance rate for the new 7000-series railcars, among other things. WMATA's new capital planning process could address some of the weaknesses it identified in its previous process, such as better distinguishing capital needs from capital projects. However, WMATA has not established documented policies and procedures for the new capital planning process, including how WMATA will rank and select individual projects for funding in its annual capital budgets and its Six-Year Capital Improvement Program.

This report examines (1) what is known about counterfeit goods entering the United States and the challenges they present, (2) efforts CBP and ICE have undertaken to enhance IPR enforcement and the extent to which they have assessed the results of these efforts, and (3) the extent to which CBP and ICE collaborate on IPR enforcement as well as ways in which they coordinate with the private sector in enforcing IPR. GAO reviewed U.S. government reports and strategic plans, analyzed CBP and ICE data, and interviewed agency officials and representatives of rights-holding companies and e-commerce websites. What GAO Found According to U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) and U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), the market for counterfeit goods in the United States has shifted from a secondary market, such as flea markets or sidewalk vendors, to a primary market, including e-commerce websites, corporate and government supply chains, and traditional retail stores, where consumers typically believe they are purchasing authentic goods. According to CBP data and ICE officials, the volume, value, and variety of counterfeit goods entering the United States increased in fiscal years 2012 through 2016, and counterfeit goods were increasingly imported in smaller express carrier or mail packages. The results of GAO's undercover purchases from third-party sellers indicate that counterfeit goods are available on a variety of popular e-commerce websites frequented by U.S. consumers. These changes in the marketplace present a number of challenges for U.S. agencies, the private sector, and consumers. First, the increasing sophistication of counterfeits can make it difficult for law enforcement officers to distinguish between legitimate and counterfeit goods. Second, the increased variety and quantity of counterfeit goods crossing the border complicates CBP and ICE enforcement efforts. Third, shifts in the mode of transportation of counterfeit goods to the United States pose additional challenges to CBP and ICE. For example, CBP and ICE have a wider variety of goods to screen, which requires CBP officials to have in-depth knowledge of a broad range of products and of how to identify counterfeits. Fourth, counterfeiters may use a variety of methods to try to deceive law enforcement or evade detection.",
    "gao_GAO-18-253": "Why GAO Did This Study DOD has taken steps to limit operational deployments for individual service members, but has been less focused on the impact of total time away from home on personnel, commonly called perstempo. Perstempo is the amount of time individual service members spend on official duty at a location or under circumstances that make it infeasible for them to spend off-duty time in the housing in which they reside. The National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2000 included a provision that required DOD to monitor the perstempo of the armed forces, and required DOD to manage the number of days its service members are deployed. Section 991 of title 10 defines \"perstempo\" as the amount of time members of the armed forces are engaged in their official duties at a location or under circumstances that make it infeasible for them to spend off-duty time in the housing in which they reside. The law also requires the Secretary of Defense or a delegated official to approve when service members exceed these thresholds, and requires DOD to establish a system for tracking and recording the number of deployment perstempo days for each member of the armed forces. In response to a mandate in the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2016, GAO was asked to review DOD's management of perstempo. This report examines (1) DOD, service, and Special Operations Command policies regarding perstempo and (2) the extent to which DOD and the services have reliable data to monitor perstempo. GAO analyzed DOD, service, and SOCOM policies and data for fiscal years 2012 through 2016 and interviewed officials from DOD, the services, and SOCOM. What GAO Found The Department of Defense (DOD), service, and Special Operations Command policies vary in identifying specific and measurable thresholds on perstempo for individual service members. DOD policy focuses on time away for deployment, which is a part of perstempo but does not encompass the full range of activities that can take service members away from home. Specifically, a 2013 memorandum from the Under Secretary of Defense for Personnel and Readiness states that individual service members should not be deployed longer than they are at their home station.

What GAO Found The Office of Personnel Management (OPM), the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), and the Chief Financial Officers Council (CFOC) have taken some steps to help provide grants training but have opportunities for further improvements. OPM, in consultation with OMB and CFOC, took several steps to ensure the federal grants management workforce has access to grants management competencies and training. For example, OPM identified grants management competencies that could be used in agency efforts for workforce planning, training and development, performance management, recruitment, and selection. OPM officials told GAO they established the 1109 job series partly because OMB and CFOC staff requested a new grants management job series in response to the increased grant awards and staffing needs created because of the 2009 American Recovery and Reinvestment Act. OMB and CFOC have provided some grants training and guidance, but use has been limited among selected agencies. OMB developed the Financial Assistance Career Roadmap Report in June 2017 and developed the online Career Roadmap Builder to help federal officials identify and document the competencies needed for successful job performance of federal financial assistance management professionals. However, almost all of the officials GAO interviewed at the 11 selected agencies were not familiar with the Career Roadmap Report and the online Career Roadmap Builder. Additionally, almost all of them did not mention using Grants Training 101 as part of their grants workforce training. OMB and CFOC have taken some actions to provide grants guidance for federal agencies that include the Career Roadmap Report, Career Roadmap Builder, and Grants Training 101. However, GAO found that almost all of the officials GAO interviewed at the 11 selected agencies were not familiar with the Career Roadmap Report and the online Career Roadmap Builder.

    "gao_GAO-19-68": "Why GAO Did This Study DOD uses Cobra Dane and other radar systems to provide information over a short period of time to ground-based interceptors so they can hit their targets. In January 2018, the Air Force reported that it had a need for Cobra Dane to meet its ballistic missile defense mission. GAO was asked to review DOD's reliance on Cobra Dane. This report examines (1) the extent to which the Air Force and MDA have shared and unique capabilities to meet mission requirements, and (2) the extent to which DOD has plans to fund Cobra Dane and its site. GAO reviewed the Air Force's report to Congress, and MDA's studies on the location of Cobra Dane and LRDR. GAO also interviewed officials from the Air Force and MDA, and reviewed relevant documents. What GAO Found The Air Force reported that the Missile Defense Agency (MDA) and the U.S. Northern Command have shared and unique capabilities to meet mission requirements, and that additional investments may reduce the department's reliance on Cobra Dane to meet mission requirements. In its report to Congress, the Air Force described how Cobra Dane and LRDR can meet mission requirements through their shared and unique capabilities, as well as how their locations affect their ability to provide those capabilities for DOD's ballistic missile defense mission. For example, the Air Force reported that Cobra Dane's location at Shemya Island, Alaska, allows it to track missile threats from North Korea earlier in their trajectories than LRDR would be able to track at Clear Air Force Station, Alaska. The Air Force also noted that LRDR's location will allow for the radar system to contribute to ballistic missile defense from North Korean and Iranian threats. DOD officials and documents GAO reviewed, however, also noted that other radar investments may reduce the department's reliance on Cobra Dane to meet mission requirements. For example, the Pacific Radar and Space Fence may reduce DOD's reliance on Cobra Dane to support ballistic missile defense and space surveillance, respectively. In its report to Congress, the Air Force noted that Cobra Dane met its requirement for operational availability\u2014i.e., the percentage of time that the radar system is able to meet its ballistic missile defense and space surveillance missions. Specifically, the Air Force reported that Co",
    "gao_GAO-18-155": "Why GAO Did This Study The biodefense enterprise is a complex set of interagency efforts to protect the nation from threats posed by biological agents. The federal government has a broad range of roles and responsibilities for biodefense, including assessing the threat of biological threats and coordinating efforts across the biodefense enterprise. GAO was asked to review the biodefense enterprise. This report examines (1) how key federal agencies use threat awareness information to inform biodefense investments and (2) the extent to which key federal agencies share biological threat information and develop a biodefense strategy. GAO reviewed relevant federal laws, policies, and guidance; analyzed agency documents and interviewed officials from key federal agencies; and reviewed relevant federal laws, policies, and guidance. What GAO Found Key federal agencies use threat awareness information to better understand threats and help make biodefense investments. For example, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and the Department of Defense (DOD) use threat awareness information to identify biological threat agents of concern and broad-based capability needs, which help guide their biodefense investments. For example, HHS and USDA conduct global disease surveillance to identify and characterize naturally occurring disease events that may impact human, animal, and plant health. In addition, the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) conduct research to characterize naturally occurring diseases and pests and pathogens. Agencies also use threat awareness information to help prioritize their investments across various biodefense enterprise activities, such as assessing the potential of biological agents to cause catastrophic harm. Multiple mechanisms exist to share biological threat information, and a new biodefense strategy could help agencies better use threat information to leverage resources across the biodefense enterprise. Officials from key federal agencies, including DHS, DOD, HHS, and USDA, identified multiple mechanisms that facilitated collaboration and shared threat awareness. These mechanisms often serve multiple purposes, such as developing policy and aiding in information sharing. However, opportunities remain to enhance threat awareness across the entire biodefense enterprise, leverage shared resources, and inform budgetary tradeoffs among various threats and agency programs. For example, the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) for Fiscal Year 2017 required DOD, HHS, DHS, and USDA to jointly develop a national biodefense strategy and associated implementation plan. The law requires the strategy to be submitted to Congress not later than 275 days after enactment (September 2017)",
    "gao_GAO-18-294": "Why GAO Did This Study The 2016 general election was the most widely used in the United States. The EAC, in conjunction with the National Institute of Standards and Technology, developed voluntary guidelines that voting equipment can be tested against to receive federal certification. The EAC also oversees the development of VVSG 2.0, which is expected to be released in late summer 2018. GAO was asked to review voting equipment replacement and development. This report addresses the following questions: (1) What types of voting equipment did local election jurisdictions use for the 2016 general election, and what are jurisdiction perspectives on equipment use and performance? (2) What factors are considered when deciding whether to replace voting equipment and what approaches have selected jurisdictions taken to replace their equipment? (3) What are selected stakeholders' perspectives on how federal voting system guidelines affect the replacement and development of voting equipment, and what actions has the EAC taken to update the guidelines? GAO surveyed a stratified random sample of 800 local election jurisdictions nationwide and interviewed election officials and subject matter experts. GAO also interviewed election officials from five local election jurisdictions selected based on population size and type of voting equipment used. What GAO Found According to GAO's survey of local election jurisdictions, jurisdictions used two types of voting equipment\u2014optical/digital scan and direct recording electronic (DRE)\u2014to process the largest number of ballots during the 2016 general election. Specifically, jurisdictions with about 63 percent of the population nationwide used optical/digital scan equipment as their predominant voting equipment, while jurisdictions with an estimated 32 percent of the population nationwide used DREs. During the 2016 general election, jurisdictions monitored the performance of their predominant voting equipment through a variety of methods, such as equipment testing, performance measurement and tracking of malfunctions, and postelection audits and recounts. According to the results of GAO's local election jurisdiction survey, jurisdictions with approximately 96 percent of the population nationwide were very satisfied or generally satisfied with the performance of their predominant voting equipment during the 2016 general election. Specifically, jurisdictions with approximately 70 percent of the population nationwide were very satisfied with their voting equipment's performance and 26 percent were generally satisfied. Among jurisdictions that used different predominant types of equipment, jurisdictions with about 37 percent of the population nationwide used multiple types of equipment. The five local election jurisdictions GAO selected to include in its review either replaced their voting equipment between 2012 and 2016 or plan to replace their",
    "gao_GAO-19-36": "Why GAO Did This Study The federal government's budget deficit is projected to grow by at least $1.2 trillion over the next 10 years. GAO was asked to review spending authority and permanent appropriations. This report (1) identifies and analyzes federal budget accounts with spending authority and permanent appropriations, including the statutory references for the authorities, changes in the number of accounts and dollar amounts since fiscal year 1994, and other relevant information; and (2) describes whether the identified accounts are subject to or exempt from sequestration or subject to any special sequestration rules or limitations. GAO analyzed fiscal year 2015 spending authority and permanent appropriations data from 24 agencies, including the Departments of Health and Human Services (HHS), Social Security Administration (SSA), and Treasury. GAO also reviewed relevant laws and OMB data. GAO also interviewed OMB staff. What GAO Found The amount of spending authority and permanent appropriations reported government-wide grew 88 percent, from fiscal years 1994 through 2015 adjusted for inflation. Specifically, in fiscal year 2015, approximately $3.2 trillion was reported, compared with approximately $1.2 trillion in fiscal year 1994 ($1.7 trillion adjusted for inflation to 2015 dollars). The amount of spending authority and permanent appropriations reported government-wide grew 88 percent, from fiscal years 1994 through 2015 adjusted for inflation. Specifically, in fiscal year 2015, approximately $3.2 trillion was reported, compared with approximately $1.2 trillion in fiscal year 1994 ($1.7 trillion adjusted for inflation to 2015 dollars). Although the total reported amount of spending authority and permanent appropriations increased over time, the changes for each authority type varied when comparing fiscal years 1994 to 2015 (see figure). Reported budget authority grew for three of the five authority types\u2014permanent appropriations, offsetting collections, and contract authority\u2014in fiscal year 2015, as compared to fiscal year 1994. For example, about $2.6 trillion permanent appropriations were reported in fiscal year 2015, up from approximately $982.5 billion in fiscal year 1994 ($1.5 trillion adjusted for inflation to 2015 dollars). Generally, the reported amount of permanent appropriations increased gradually, with the biggest growth occurring in fiscal year 2008. Borrowing authority decreased, and agencies reported no use of monetary credits or bartering at any time during fiscal years 1995 through 2015. The majority of spending authority and permanent appropriations reported in fiscal year 2015 was concentrated in large agencies and budget accounts that fund entitlement",
    "gao_GAO-18-201": "Why GAO Did This Study VA provides health care to nearly 9 million veterans annually. VA has faced a growing demand for its health care services, due in part to both service members returning from military operations in Afghanistan and Iraq and to the growing needs of an aging veteran population. VA is expected to provide a safe environment not only for the veterans, but also for staff and visitors at a diverse makeup of VHA facilities. GAO was asked to review VA's risk management program. This report assesses (1) the extent that VA's policies for physical-security risk management reflect elements of federally established risk management standards and (2) VA's oversight of risk management of physical security at VHA facilities. GAO reviewed VA policies and procedures, interviewed VA officials, and conducted semi-structured interviews with nine selected VHA medical centers. What GAO Found The Department of Veterans Affairs' (VA) risk management process does not fully reflect the Interagency Security Committee's (ISC) standards for assessing physical security. VA's risk management process includes some elements of ISC's process but is missing other elements, gaps that could result in risks' not being fully assessed and appropriate countermeasures not being identified. For example, VA policy calls for three of the factors to be used in determining a facility's risk level, which partially reflects the ISC Standard. VA policy also does not articulate that factors used to determine the overall risk value be equally weighted, nor does it include facility population and facility size as factors. As a result, VA may not be considering all the relevant risk factors that make a facility a more or less desirable target for threats. VA also lacks documented policies or performance measures in place for assessing the effectiveness of its security program, which does not reflect the ISC Standard. VA officials said that they are currently reexamining their policies but have not reached out to the ISC for assistance. Without a policy that establishes uniform performance measures, VA cannot evaluate the effectiveness of physical security programs being locally implemented across its facilities. VA lacks an oversight strategy that includes elements of ISC standards. For example, VA does not assess the effectiveness of its risk management process, the extent to which recommended security measures have been implemented, or decisions not to implement security recommendations. Without a system-wide oversight strategy, VA cannot assess the overall performance of its security program and whether medical centers are adequately protected. Without a system",
    "gao_GAO-18-642T": "Why GAO Did This Study Money laundering and terrorist financing are a growing concern in the United States. In February 2018, GAO reported that money laundering risk was high in the Southwest border region because of the high volume of cash transactions, the number of cross-border transactions, and foreign account holders. GAO also reported that money transmitters serving selected countries reported losing bank accounts or having restrictions placed on them, which some banks confirmed. This testimony discusses (1) the factors that have been identified as affecting banks' decisions to close or limit accounts and (2) the extent to which Treasury has assessed the effects of money transmitter and foreign bank account closures on remittance flows to fragile countries. This statement is based on GAO's February 2018 report, Money Laundering: Bank Account Closures and Remittance Flows to Fragile Countries (GAO-2018-02-46). GAO reviewed relevant laws, regulations, and guidance; surveyed banks and money transmitters; and interviewed officials from Treasury, the federal banking regulators, and other organizations. What GAO Found In February 2018, GAO reported that money laundering risk is high in the Southwest border region because of the high volume of cash transactions, the number of cross-border transactions, and foreign account holders. GAO's nationally representative survey found that many Southwest border banks may be engaging in derisking. Nationally, GAO's econometric analysis suggested that counties that were urban, younger, had higher income, or had higher money laundering-related risk were more likely to lose branches. Money laundering-related risks were likely to have been relatively more important drivers of branch closures in the Southwest border region. In March 2018, GAO found that money transmitters serving selected countries reported losing bank accounts or having restrictions placed on them, which some banks confirmed. As a result, some money transmitters relied on nonbanking channels, such as cash couriers, to transfer remittances. All 12 money transmitters GAO interviewed at the time reported losing some banking relationships in the last 10 years. Some money transmitters, including all 4 that served Somalia, said they relied on nonbanking channels, such as moving cash, to transfer funds, which increased their operational costs and exposure to risks. Treasury officials noted that despite information that some money transmitters had lost banking accounts, Treasury saw no evidence that the volume of remittances was falling or that costs",
    "gao_GAO-17-785": "Why GAO Did This Study The Telecommunications Act of 1996 (the Act) required FCC to set regulations to assure the commercial availability of devices that access video programming. FCC's proposed rule would have required consumers to use a set-top box to access video programming. The Act also required FCC to report annually on the status of competition in the video marketplace. GAO was asked to review the market for video services and devices to access video programming. This report examines (1) the role of set-top boxes in delivering video programming and (2) the extent to which FCC has conducted a comprehensive analysis to support the Act's requirements regarding consumer choice for set-top boxes. GAO reviewed FCC's proposed rule and most recent annual video competition reports, and interviewed FCC officials and industry stakeholders. What GAO Found While over 75 percent of households still subscribe to video services and rely on a set-top box leased from their provider to access content, the Internet has created more opportunities for consumers to access video programming services in ways that do not require a set-top box. These providers vary regarding the types of video services they offer: content aggregators (e.g., Netflix and Amazon) and direct to consumer (e.g., CBS All Access, HBONow, and Univision Now). These providers also offer live and on-demand programming directly to consumers through the Internet for a monthly subscription. While over 75 percent of households still subscribe to MVPDs for video services and rely on a set-top box leased from their provider to access content, the Internet has created more opportunities for consumers to access video programming services in ways that do not require a set-top box.

    "gao_GAO-18-493": "Why GAO Did This Study DOD has spent billions of dollars developing and acquiring space systems in the past decade. DOD has been considering new architectures and acquisition approaches to increase resiliency. DOD has used commercially hosted payloads to achieve cost savings and on-orbit capability more quickly. GAO was asked to review DOD's use of commercially hosted payloads. This report examines (1) the extent to which DOD has used commercially hosted payloads and (2) the factors contributing to DOD's limited use of these payloads. GAO reviewed DOD and other documents and interviewed officials from DOD, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, and other government agencies. What GAO Found Since 2009, the Department of Defense (DOD) has used commercially hosted payloads\u2014intended to test or demonstrate an on-orbit capability\u2014for three programs on commercial host satellites. DOD estimates that it has achieved cost savings of several hundred million dollars from these experimental payloads. DOD officials told GAO that experimental payloads tend to be smaller, less expensive, and their missions more risk-tolerant than traditional operational DOD payloads. In these ways, they said experimental payloads are better-suited to hosting arrangements than operational DOD payloads. DOD and Air Force officials told GAO they are planning to pursue commercially hosted payloads for three programs in the coming decade to achieve cost savings and on-orbit capability more quickly. Two factors have contributed to DOD's limited use of commercially hosted payloads. First, DOD officials identified logistical challenges to matching government payloads with any given commercial host satellite. For example, most of the offices GAO spoke with cited size, weight, and power constraints, among others, as barriers to using hosted payloads. Second, while individual DOD offices have realized cost and schedule benefits, DOD as a whole has limited information on costs and benefits of hosted payloads. Further, the knowledge it has gathered is fragmented across the agency\u2014with multiple offices collecting piecemeal information on the use of hosted payloads. The limited knowledge and data on hosted payloads that is fragmented across the agency has contributed to resistance among space acquisition officials to adopting this approach.",
    "gao_GAO-19-52": "Why GAO Did This Study Privacy is a key component of the federal government's ability to protect consumers from unfair and deceptive practices. FTC is primarily a law enforcement agency that, among other responsibilities, oversees Internet privacy. GAO was asked to review FTC's oversight of Internet privacy. This report examines (1) the benefits and concerns of consumers' data collection and use from the Internet, (2) the extent to which FTC and FCC have used their authority to oversee Internet privacy, and (3) potential actions that could enhance FTC's oversight of Internet privacy. GAO reviewed relevant federal laws and regulations, and interviewed officials from FTC, FCC, and the Department of Commerce. GAO also reviewed relevant literature and interviewed stakeholders from academia, industry, and government. What GAO Found Various stakeholders GAO interviewed\u2014including those from academia, industry, and government\u2014said that there should be a balance between the freedom of companies to collect and use consumers' data needed to provide services and the necessity to protect consumers' privacy. In general, industry stakeholders highlighted the benefits of data collection and use, such as facilitating innovation, while consumer advocacy groups and other stakeholders emphasized concerns about consumers' loss of control over their data and their lack of understanding of how companies collect and use their information. Additionally, surveys and other literature that GAO reviewed on Internet privacy highlighted concerns among consumers. For example, according to a recent Pew Research Center survey, 45 percent of American households surveyed reported major concerns about credit card fraud. In addition, according to a recent Pew Research Center survey, 45 percent of American households surveyed reported major concerns about identity theft, credit card or banking fraud, data collection by online services, loss of control over personal information, and threats to personal safety. FTC and FCC have used different approaches to oversee Internet privacy. FTC primarily uses settlement agreements with a range of companies to address Internet privacy violations. During the last decade, FTC filed 101 Internet privacy enforcement actions for practices that the agency alleged were unfair, deceptive, a violation of the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA), a violation of a settlement agreement, or a combination of those reasons. Most of these actions pertained to first-time violations of the FTC Act for which FTC does not have the authority to levy civil penalties. In those cases where a party violated an FTC regulation",

Reverse auctions are used by federal agencies to acquire low-cost, commercial products and services. GAO was asked to review federal agencies' use of reverse auctions. This report examines (1) federal agencies' use of reverse auctions between 2013 and 2017, (2) the extent to which selected agencies achieved benefits through reverse auctions, and (3) the extent to which selected agencies have insight into reverse auction fees. GAO analyzed fiscal year 2013 through 2017 data from reverse auction providers, reviewed agency policies and guidance, and interviewed agency officials. GAO also reviewed fiscal year 2016 data from reverse auction providers and interviewed contracting officials at five agencies\u2014Army, DHS, Interior, and VA\u2014based on contract award dates and dollar value. What GAO Found GAO found the value of awarded reverse auctions decreased approximately 22 percent across the government between 2013 and 2017, from about $1.9 billion to about $1.5 billion. Although the number of auctions consistently decreased each year from 2013 to 2017, the dollar value of auctions increased after 2015, indicating that some individual reverse auctions have been for larger dollar values in the past couple of years. During this same period, the overall trend in federal contract obligations initially decreased from 2013 through 2015 and then increased overall through 2017\u2014from about $490 billion in 2013 to $508 billion in 2017. Hence, since 2013, contracts awarded through reverse auctions have consistently represented less than 0.5 percent of federal contract spending. In addition, almost all auctions and the vast majority of dollars agencies awarded between 2013 and 2017 resulted from the use of the Federal Reserve Bank of America's (FedBid) reverse auction platform. GAO also found that the dollar value of awarded reverse auctions varied from 2013 to 2017 across the six agencies GAO reviewed, with total reverse auction value greater in 2017 than in 2013 for half of the agencies (DHS, Navy, and State). The agencies GAO reviewed obtained iterative bidding, indicating enhanced competition between multiple vendors, in nearly three-quarters of reverse auctions, and contracting officials cited reduced administrative burden as another key benefit, but determining the actual amount of savings is challenging due to data issues. GAO found that reverse auctions with iterative bidding resulted in award prices that were, on average, about 12 percent lower than",

In response to an August 2015 Federal Register notice announcing the pilot, Education officials reported receiving applications from over 200 schools seeking to participate. GAO was asked to review the pilot. This report examines (1) actions Education and other stakeholders took to implement the pilot, and (2) what is known about the effects of participation in postsecondary education while incarcerated. GAO reviewed Education's guidance and data on the pilot's objectives, and interviewed officials from 12 schools and seven correctional institutions that partnered with the participating schools. GAO also interviewed officials from a non-generalizable sample of 12 schools and seven correctional institutions. What GAO Found The Department of Education (Education) selected 64 schools to participate in the Second Chance Pell pilot, which allows a limited number of students to receive Pell grants despite their incarceration. Education officials said they selected schools for the pilot that varied along several characteristics, including location and size, as well as ensuring that selected schools did not have a history of compliance issues or other problems delivering federal student aid. Education officials said they selected schools for the pilot that varied along several characteristics, including location and size, as well as ensuring that selected schools did not have a history of compliance issues or other problems delivering federal student aid. Education officials said they collaborated with a variety of stakeholders to prepare for and to implement the pilot, such as individuals working in academic departments, financial aid, the registrar, and academic advising. Officials from 12 of the 64 schools GAO interviewed reported experiencing some challenges establishing incarcerated applicants' eligibility for Pell grants, including establishing an applicant's citizenship or eligible non-citizenship and providing accurate Social Security Numbers or Alien Registration Numbers. Officials from all 12 schools said they experienced challenges addressing these challenges, such as obtaining documentation from the Selective Service System, which is a federal agency that helps individuals obtain federal student aid. Officials from 8 of the 12 schools reported hiring additional staff or allocating more staff hours to help manage the increased administrative workload. Officials from 9 of the 12 schools reported developing new approaches to address challenges related to processing applicants' Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA).

The act also required GAO to review implementation of the act. This report (1) identifies key practices for transparently reporting government data on a centralized website, and (2) evaluates the extent to which the new USAspending.gov is consistent with these key practices, as well as existing standards for federal websites. GAO reviewed literature and interviewed officials from Treasury, OMB, and GSA, and selected state and local governments. GAO also reviewed Treasury's and OMB's guidance and interviewed officials from Treasury, OMB, and GSA. What GAO Found GAO identified five key practices that managers of open government data programs can consider to help ensure the transparent presentation of their data. These practices are intended to be used in tandem with requirements for federal government websites and open data programs, such as relevant laws and Office of Management and Budget (OMB) guidance. GAO identified these key practices and actions by systematically evaluating and synthesizing information from literature on open data as well as interviews with open data experts and good governance groups. These key practices and actions are intended to be used in tandem with requirements for federal government websites and open data programs, such as relevant laws and OMB guidance. GAO identified four key actions for providing data in useful formats: (1) Provide detailed and disaggregated data. Data are most useful when they are provided in as much granularity as possible. For example, Kansas City, Missouri's, open data website allows users to view detailed, disaggregated data in a user-friendly checkbook format. (2) Provide data in useful formats.

DOD has taken steps to increase efficiencies in its document services, including implementing a transformation plan for DLA Document Services, taking steps to reduce the cost and number of office print devices, and increasing its use of electronic content management. GAO was asked to review DOD's document services. This report evaluates (1) the progress DOD has made in achieving efficiencies in its document services and opportunities, if any, for further efficiencies, and (2) the extent to which DOD reports accurate financial information about its document services to key stakeholders. GAO reviewed DOD documents and interviewed DOD officials. GAO also analyzed DOD's operation and maintenance (O&M) budget justification materials for fiscal years 2012 through 2016 and Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) data on its document services mission. What GAO Found The Department of Defense (DOD) has taken steps toward achieving efficiencies in its document services, including implementing a transformation plan for DLA Document Services, taking steps to reduce the cost and number of office print devices, and increasing its use of electronic content management. However, GAO identified four areas where further gains may be possible: better managing fragmentation in printing and reproduction services, reducing overlap in procuring print devices, meeting goals to reduce the number of print devices, and consolidating locations that provide mission specialty printing. DOD's transformation plan generally reflects leading practices for initiatives to consolidate physical infrastructure or management functions. For example, DLA Document Services identified goals for its transformation plan, ensured top leadership engagement, dedicated an implementation team, and established metrics that it is using to track progress toward the plan's goals. DOD's efforts to reduce the cost and number of print devices have also been successful, but GAO identified four areas where further gains may be possible: (1) managing fragmentation in printing and reproduction services, (2) reducing overlap in procuring print devices, (3) meeting goals to reduce the number of print devices, and (4) consolidating locations that provide mission specialty printing. DOD has not implemented a department-wide approach for acquiring print devices, and DOD components use at least four different sources to acquire them, with costs that vary widely for similar devices.

This report assesses the steps OMB and GSA have taken to fulfill their government-wide responsibilities related to physical access control system implementation requirements and identifies challenges selected federal agencies face in adhering to federal physical access control system requirements. GAO reviewed relevant federal laws, regulations, and guidance; interviewed officials from OMB and GSA; and reviewed documents from five selected agencies with a range of facilities and responsibilities. GAO also interviewed physical access control system manufacturers, integrators, and other stakeholders. What GAO Found The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and the General Services Administration (GSA) have taken steps to help agencies procure and implement secure and interoperable GSA-approved physical access control systems across the federal government. For example, OMB has issued three guidance memorandums to clarify agency responsibility to use GSA's Approved Products List. In addition, GSA, as the lead agency for government-wide acquisition of information technology, has undertaken a number of efforts to promote the implementation of GSA-approved physical access control systems. For example, OMB has issued three guidance memorandums to clarify agency responsibility to use GSA's Approved Products List. In addition, GSA, as the lead agency for government-wide acquisition of information technology, has undertaken a number of efforts to promote the implementation of GSA-approved physical access control systems. For example, GSA has fully tested all physical access control system equipment included on the Approved Products List and evaluated and approved the suitability of vendors and system integrators. However, neither OMB nor GSA collects data on agency efforts to implement physical access control system requirements, including use of the Approved Products List. This is significant because GAO's interviews with physical access control system manufacturers, integrators, and selected agencies indicate that government-wide implementation of physical access control systems may be limited and raises questions about government-wide progress. Officials from four of the five selected agencies GAO reviewed told GAO that, since 2013, when physical access control system end-to-end testing",

GAO was asked to review BOP's use of retention incentives. This report examines (1) how BOP has used its authority to pay retention incentives; (2) what internal controls are in place for the use of retention incentives; and (3) the extent to which BOP plans for and evaluates the use of retention incentives. GAO analyzed BOP data on retention incentive expenditures and employee-level retention incentive payroll data from fiscal years 2012 through 2016, reviewed BOP policies and procedures, and interviewed BOP officials. What GAO Found The Bureau of Prisons (BOP) used retention incentives primarily to retain staff in California and for medical professionals nationwide. From fiscal years 2012 through 2016, BOP spent more than 97 percent of its total retention incentive expenditures on employees at four California institutions and for medical professionals nationwide. Four of these institutions\u2014United States Penitentiary (USP) Atwater, Federal Correctional Institution (FCI) Herlong, Federal Correctional Complex (FCC) Victorville, and Federal Correctional Complex (FCC) Victorville\u2014constituted the largest portion of BOP's total retention incentive expenditures. Additionally, the four California institutions' retention incentive expenditures remained relatively steady\u2014around $8.1 to $8.2 million during the 5-year period\u2014even though the overall number of employees receiving the incentives generally increased. BOP has a number of internal controls in place to ensure that retention incentive applications and approvals meet requirements. BOP officials told GAO that these controls are part of a multilayered application and review process that begins at the institution and culminates at BOP's Central Office. GAO's review of a random sample of 40 retention incentive application packet case files for fiscal years 2014 through 2016 found that they all generally incorporated the internal controls described by officials. BOP officials told GAO that they conduct periodic audits and reviews of its human capital activities and related internal controls, to ensure that retention incentives are being used appropriately. BOP officials stated that planning for human capital needs is conducted at institutions during quarterly workforce utilization meetings or manpower salary meetings. While BOP takes a number of steps to determine current workforce needs and how to fill those needs, BOP does not strategically plan for how retention incentives can be used to meet long-term human",

DOE's prime contracts are the largest contracts in the federal government. GAO was asked to review DOE's prime contracts. This report examines (1) the entities that participated in DOE's prime contracts, (2) the extent to which they subcontracted their work, and (3) the entities that participated in those subcontracts during fiscal year 2016. GAO reviewed relevant laws, regulations, and guidance; analyzed prime contract data; and interviewed DOE officials and contractors. What GAO Found In fiscal year 2016, 28 entities were party to the Department of Energy's (DOE) 24 largest prime contracts. Specifically, 11 of the 28 entities were parties to multiple prime contracts. The prime contracts in which these 11 entities participated represented about 69 percent, or $19.3 billion, of DOE's total prime contract obligations in fiscal year 2016. The prime contracts in which these 11 entities participated represented about 69 percent, or $19.3 billion, of DOE's total prime contract obligations in fiscal year 2016. The extent to which contractors obligated funds to subcontracts in fiscal year 2016 varied widely, from 13 percent of prime contract obligations to 83 percent. The contractors in GAO's selection reported obligating funds to more than 169,000 subcontracts to about 23,000 different entities in fiscal year 2016. Contractors subcontracted more than $6.9 billion, an amount equivalent to nearly 30 percent of DOE's obligations to its prime contracts in fiscal year 2016. The contractors in GAO's selection reported obligating funds to more than 169,000 subcontracts to about 23,000 different entities in fiscal year 2016. For example, one contractor had never completed an adequate audit of its subcontractors' incurred costs over the 16 years of the prime contract period, although its prime contract with DOE requires such audits. DOE does not know the full extent of unallowable subcontractor costs that it has reimbursed because required subcontract audits were not always conducted. For some contractors, the issue of unaudited subcontract costs is long-standing and extensive. For example, one contractor had never completed an adequate audit of its subcontractors' incurred costs over the 16 years of the prime contract period, although its prime contract with DOE requires such audits. DOE did not always ensure that contractors completed required subcontract audits. Specifically, DOE did not always ensure",

DODIG and the military service IGs share responsibility for investigating misconduct and whistleblower reprisal complaints. GAO was asked to review DODIG and the military service IGs' handling of whistleblower complaints. This report examines the extent to which DODIG and the military service IGs met and took steps to achieve key fiscal year 2018 timeliness and quality goals related to the handling of whistleblower complaints. GAO reviewed DODIG and military service IG performance data and policies and procedures, and interviewed cognizant officials. What GAO Found The Department of Defense (DOD) Office of Inspector General (DODIG) and the military service offices of inspector general (IG) met and took steps to achieve key fiscal year 2018 timeliness and quality goals related to the handling of whistleblower complaints. DODIG met some but not all internal timeliness goals for fiscal year 2018 related to the intake and referral of whistleblower allegations, as well as the oversight of DOD component investigations. DODIG officials cited several reasons for not meeting timeliness goals, including a backlog of cases and a lengthy report review process. DODIG officials noted that the number of whistleblower reprisal cases increased from 1,013 to 2,002 (98 percent) over the past 5 years, while an internal DODIG fiscal year 2018 performance report cited other reasons for not meeting timeliness goals, including the assumption of responsibility for all sexual assault victim reprisal cases by the whistleblower reprisal investigations unit, the number of high-priority senior official cases concurrently open, and the increasing scope and complexity of investigations. DODIG and the military service IGs have implemented and planned various initiatives to improve the timeliness of their processing of senior official misconduct and reprisal complaints. However, these initiatives do not target all aspects of timeliness\u2014including those pertaining to senior official misconduct investigations conducted by the military service IGs, military service IG notifications made to DODIG, and military service IG intake reviews for reprisal cases. Further, DODIG and the military service IGs have not agreed on the timeframes prescribed by DOD policy for military service IGs to notify DODIG of the receipt",

UN peacekeeping operations are a key component of the U.S. national security strategy. UN peacekeeping operations are a multidimensional operation that deploys civilian and police personnel in addition to military personnel. GAO was asked to review UN peacekeeping operations. This report (1) compares reported costs of a specific UN peacekeeping operation to the estimated costs of a hypothetical, comparable operation implemented by the United States; (2) identifies factors that affect cost differences; and (3) identifies stakeholder views on the relative strengths of UN and U.S. peacekeeping operations. GAO analyzed UN budget and expenditure data, interviewed U.S. and UN officials, and compared the reported costs of a specific UN peacekeeping operation to the estimated costs of a hypothetical, comparable operation implemented by the United States. GAO also interviewed U.S. and UN officials and reviewed UN reports on peacekeeping operations. What GAO Found Based on data and other input from the United Nations (UN), the Department of Defense (DOD), and State, GAO estimates that it would cost the United States more than twice as much as it would cost the UN to implement a hypothetical operation comparable to the ongoing UN Multidimensional Integrated Stabilization Mission in the Central African Republic (MINUSCA), the ongoing UN operation in the Central African Republic (CAR). Using roughly the same basic parameters for MINUSCA, including similar deployment levels of military and civilian personnel over the same time period, in consultation with DOD and State officials, GAO estimates that a comparable, hypothetical U.S. operation would likely cost nearly $5.7 billion, more than twice the UN cost for MINUSCA. In addition, the estimated cost of a U.S. operation in CAR far exceeds U.S. contributions to MINUSCA. Various factors contribute to the differences in costs between actual UN expenditures for MINUSCA and a hypothetical, comparable U.S. operation over the same time period, including disparities in the cost of sourcing and transporting equipment and supplies, staffing and compensating military and police personnel, and maintaining facilities and communications and intelligence systems. These disparities reflect operational, structural, and doctrinal differences in the way the United States likely would undertake a hypothetical, comparable operation, should such an operation",

ICE uses two key variables\u2014the bed rate and ADP\u2014to calculate its budget request. GAO was asked to review ICE's budget request. This report examines (1) how ICE calculates its budget request and how it uses these variables, and (2) the extent to which ICE's cost estimate for immigration detention resources meets best practices outlined in GAO's Cost Estimating and Assessment Guide. GAO reviewed ICE's budget request and ADP, and interviewed ICE officials. What GAO Found U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) follows budget formulation guidance from the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), and uses two key variables\u2014the bed rate and ADP\u2014when formulating its budget request. ICE uses two key variables\u2014the bed rate and ADP\u2014to calculate its budget request. ICE uses these variables to calculate its budget request. ICE's budget request includes a total of $34.7 million for fiscal year 2014 and $129 million for fiscal year 2015, and compared it with ICE's requested amount. ICE officials acknowledged the error and stated that the final appropriation ultimately was not based on its budget request numbers and ICE's detention activities were funded at an amount that was greater than what they requested. ICE officials stated that there are multiple reviews of the budget documents prior to submission to ensure that the numbers presented are accurate and supportable. However, ICE could not provide documentation that the reviews were conducted. ICE uses historical costs to develop its projected bed rate, but underestimated the actual bed rate from fiscal years 2014 through 2017. ICE uses historical costs to develop its projected bed rate, but did not provide documentation of its rationale. ICE officials stated that historical costs more accurately reflect potential increases, but did not provide documentation of its rationale. ICE officials stated that ICE's most substantial change to the bed rate since its creation in 2009 was a revision in 2014 to account for the costs of family facilities. By reviewing its bed rate model and methodology and correcting identified inaccuracies and other potential issues, ICE could improve its bed rate projections and better ensure its funding requests are credible and reliable. ICE reported using ADP figures that are based on policy decisions, but it is unclear if the ADP figures",

This report examines (1) how selected colleges prepare for emergencies, (2) the resources available to colleges to help them prepare for emergencies, and (3) the extent to which federal agencies share information about resources for emergency preparedness among colleges. GAO reviewed relevant federal laws and regulations, and interviewed federal officials and representatives from colleges, state agencies, and other organizations. GAO also reviewed relevant federal websites and interviewed federal officials. What GAO Found Colleges prepare for emergencies by involving the campus community, developing and publicizing plans, and partnering with local and state agencies. College officials GAO interviewed described preparations for a range of emergencies and used a variety of tools to communicate and practice their plans. For example, most officials said they prioritized at least one type of natural disaster that could occur in their geographical area, as well as manmade threats like active shooters. College officials also described partnering with local and state partners to develop their emergency plans and identify roles in the event of an emergency, adhere to state requirements, or obtain resources. Officials at most of the 18 selected colleges said they relied on either their local or state partners, or both, for advice, questions, or to obtain resources for emergency preparedness. Officials at most of the selected colleges said they worked with partners in their local community, such as police and fire departments, hospitals, and emergency management offices, in preparing for emergencies. Officials at most of the selected colleges said they received some state written guidance, training, or technical assistance that was either specifically tailored to colleges, or was designed for various entities including colleges. Various sub-agencies within the Departments of Homeland Security (DHS), Justice (DOJ), and Education (Education) are involved in developing and providing emergency preparedness resources for colleges. These three agencies use a variety of methods to provide resources, such as written guidance, webinars, and individual technical assistance. College officials GAO interviewed cited mixed awareness regarding federal resources developed specifically for them. For example, officials at all 18 colleges said they were aware of DHS's Federal Emergency Management Agency resources focused on general emergency preparedness, such as NIMS. However, GAO found that college emergency managers were less frequently aware of college-specific resources produced or funded by Education, DOJ, and others.",

NRC's Office of Inspector General (OIG) and internal reviews conducted by NRC in the last 5 years identified problems with the agency's billing process. In 2012 and 2015, for example, OIG audits identified problems with NRC's management and review of billable charges and recommended changes to the agency's internal processes and procedures\u2014called internal controls\u2014to improve the accuracy of invoices. In 2013, NRC launched the Business Process Improvement Project to determine the root causes of billing errors, many of which were discovered during the quarterly validation step of the billing process. GAO was asked to review NRC's billing process. This report examines (1) actions NRC has taken to address problems identified by OIG and NRC internal reviews and (2) challenges that licensees identified with NRC's billing process and NRC's recent and planned changes to its billing process. GAO reviewed NRC documents and interviewed NRC staff and 13 licensees selected based on their experience with NRC's billing process and other factors. What GAO Found The Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) has recently implemented or plans to implement changes in four main areas of its billing process to address problems identified by OIG and NRC internal reviews: controls over activity codes, guidance and training for NRC staff, quarterly validation of charges, and charging licensees for billable overhead costs. NRC's OIG and internal reviews identified problems with NRC's internal controls over activity codes, which affected the quality of data used for billing and other agency processes. NRC also did not have a standardized set of activity codes to be used across the agency. NRC also did not have a standardized set of activity codes to be used across the agency. According to an internal NRC review, the decentralized management and absence of standardized activity codes weakened internal controls and put NRC at risk for incomplete or inaccurate billing. NRC also provided training to all agency staff to emphasize the importance of accurate time and labor reporting and management of billable contracts, which, according to NRC documents, contributed to avoidable time card errors and billing errors. NRC also revised its guidance to clarify responsibilities, procedures, and instructions for reviewing and approving contractor invoices. NRC also began charging licensees for billable",

The 2015 NDAA included a provision for GAO to review the WOSB program. This report examines (1) the extent to which SBA has implemented changes to the WOSB program made by the 2015 NDAA; (2) the extent to which SBA has implemented changes to address previously identified oversight deficiencies; and (3) changes in WOSB program use since 2011 and stakeholder views on its use, including since the 2015 implementation of sole-source authority. GAO reviewed relevant legislation, SBA regulations, and SBA documentation; analyzed federal procurement data from fiscal years 2011 through 2018; and interviewed SBA officials and 14 stakeholder groups, selected based on their use of the WOSB program and other factors. What GAO Found The Small Business Administration (SBA) has implemented one of the three changes that the 2015 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) made to the Women-Owned Small Business Program (WOSB program)\u2014sole-source authority. The two other changes\u2014authorizing SBA to implement its own certification process for WOSBs and requiring SBA to eliminate the WOSB self-certification option\u2014have not been implemented.

SBA officials have stated that they will not eliminate self-certification until the new certification process for the WOSB program is in place, which they expect to be completed by January 1, 2020. SBA has not fully addressed deficiencies in its oversight of third-party certifiers that GAO identified in its October 2014 report. For example, SBA did not have formal policies for reviewing the performance of its four approved third-party certifiers, including their compliance with their agreements with SBA. Further, SBA had not developed formal policies and procedures for, among other things, reviewing the monthly reports that certifiers submit to SBA. As a result, GAO recommended that SBA establish comprehensive procedures to monitor and assess the performance of the certifiers in accordance with their agreements with SBA and program regulations. SBA has taken some steps to address the recommendation",

In fiscal year 2017, ATF referred about 13,000 firearms denials to its field divisions for investigation, of which USAOs had prosecuted 12 cases. GAO was asked to review ATF's efforts to investigate and prosecute firearms denials. This report (1) describes the extent to which ATF and selected state law enforcement agencies investigate and prosecute firearms denial cases; (2) examines the challenges, if any, that federal and selected state law enforcement agencies face in investigating and prosecuting firearms denial cases; and (3) describes the circumstances that lead to the investigation and prosecution of persons denied firearms. GAO reviewed ATF data on firearms denials and state law enforcement efforts, and interviewed officials from ATF and selected state law enforcement agencies. What GAO Found In fiscal year 2017, ATF referred about 13,000 firearms denials to its field divisions for investigation, of which USAOs had prosecuted 12 cases as of June 2018. The number of firearms denials referred to ATF field divisions for investigation increased from 5,208 in fiscal year 2011 to 12,710 in fiscal year 2017, an increase of 141 percent. Officials from 10 of 13 selected state law enforcement agencies said that they do not investigate or prosecute firearms denials, sometimes citing resource availability or the lack of state statutes as the reason. Officials from the remaining three state law enforcement agencies said that they investigate a high proportion of firearms denials. These three states have statutes prohibiting providing false information on a state or federal firearms form as well as statutes that penalize the attempt to purchase firearms by individuals prohibited from such purchases. ATF and selected state law enforcement agencies cited challenges investigating and prosecuting firearms denials, including the high volume of firearms denial referrals for investigation that ATF sends to field divisions. ATF officials said that investigating firearms denials can be challenging because of the high volume and require use of their limited resources. ATF has not assessed field divisions' use of warning notices in lieu of prosecution, which could provide greater awareness of their deterrence value.

FCC's 2010 National Broadband Plan stated that tribes needed substantially greater financial support than was available to them at the time and that accelerating tribal broadband deployment would require increased funding. GAO was asked to review FCC's efforts to increase broadband deployment on tribal lands. This statement discusses (1) FCC's data on broadband access on tribal lands and (2) the extent to which tribes have access to federal funding for broadband deployment on tribal lands. This statement is based on GAO's September 2018 report on broadband access on tribal lands and selected updates conducted in September 2018. GAO reviewed FCC's National Broadband Plan and RUS's funding data for broadband deployment on tribal lands and interviewed FCC and RUS officials and representatives from tribes, broadband providers, and associations. What GAO Found In its September 2018 report on broadband access on tribal lands, GAO found that the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) collects broadband availability data from broadband providers, but its method for collecting the data does not accurately or completely capture broadband access\u2014the ability to obtain service\u2014on tribal lands. Specifically, FCC directs fixed broadband providers to submit a list of census blocks where service is available on their Form 477 filings. FCC defines \u201cavailable\u201d as whether the provider does\u2014or could, within a typical service interval or without an extraordinary commitment of resources\u2014provide service to at least one end-user premises in a census block. Thus, in its annual reports and maps of fixed broadband service, FCC considers an entire block to be served if a provider reports that it does, or could offer, service to at least one household in the census block. FCC's definition of availability leads to overstatements of fixed broadband availability on tribal lands by: (1) counting an entire census block as served if only one location has broadband, and (2) allowing providers to report availability in blocks where they do not have any infrastructure connecting homes to their networks if the providers determine they could offer service to at least one household. FCC has noted that overstatements of availability can be particularly problematic in rural areas, where census blocks cover larger areas.

GAO was asked to review federal agencies' efforts to implement cloud services. This report examines (1) the extent to which selected agencies have implemented cloud services and the extent to which they have made progress in implementing them, and (2) the extent to which selected agencies have reported savings and cost avoidances from implementing cloud services. GAO reviewed OMB guidance and OMB guidance, and interviewed officials from OMB and 16 selected agencies (Education, General Services Administration, Labor, Small Business Administration, and State). What GAO Found The 16 selected agencies reported making progress in implementing cloud services\u2014namely, they established guidance for assessing investments for cloud services, performed those assessments, and implemented cloud services for their investments. However, the extent of these agencies' progress varied. Specifically, 10 of the 16 agencies established guidance for assessing all new and existing investments for cloud services, while six agencies did not. In addition, while these agencies had assessed the majority of their investments for cloud services planned for fiscal year 2019, 12 agencies had not completed an assessment of 10 or more IT investments for cloud services. Lastly, 10 of the agencies reported a percentage increase in the use of cloud services from fiscal year 2016 through fiscal year 2019, while two agencies reported no percentage change and four agencies reported a decrease during this 4-year period. The 16 agencies in GAO's review made progress in implementing cloud services. Specifically, the 16 agencies reported that their spending on cloud investments had increased by over $1 billion between fiscal years 2015 and 2018, for investments with total life-cycle costs of $1 million or more. However, the agencies reported that factors such as inconsistent tracking of spending data, along with confusion in interpreting OMB guidance, impacted the accuracy of their reported cloud spending data. In addition, 13 of the 16 agencies reported that they had saved hundreds of millions of dollars on cloud services, but agencies reported that they had problems with tracking this data. Further, six agencies reported that they had reinvested cloud savings into other IT modernization efforts or other improvements to IT services. Officials from 15 of the 16 agencies in GAO's review reported that they had realized several significant benefits from the adoption of cloud services, ranging from improvements in the delivery of IT services to increasing the efficiency of operations and systems.

In leading the federal government's efforts to secure its nation's public and private critical infrastructure information systems, the department, among other things, collects and shares information related to cyber threats and cybersecurity risks and incidents with other federal partners to enable real-time actions to address these risks and incidents. The Homeland Security Cybersecurity Workforce Assessment Act of 2014 required DHS to perform workforce assessment-related activities to identify and assign employment codes to its cybersecurity positions. This statement discusses DHS's efforts to (1) identify and assign employment codes to its cybersecurity positions, and (2) identify and report its cybersecurity workforce areas of critical need. This statement is based on GAO's February 2018 report, Cybersecurity: Federal Efforts Are Under Way That May Address Workforce Challenges, GAO-17-533T (Washington, D.C.: Apr. 4, 2017). GAO reviewed relevant laws, regulations, and guidance; analyzed DHS data on its cybersecurity positions and work categories and specialty areas; and interviewed DHS officials. What GAO Found The Homeland Security Cybersecurity Workforce Assessment Act of 2014 required the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to perform workforce assessment-related activities to identify and assign employment codes to its cybersecurity positions. Specifically, the act called for DHS to (1) establish procedures for identifying and categorizing cybersecurity positions and assigning codes to positions (within 90 days of law's enactment); (2) identify all filled and vacant positions with cybersecurity functions and determine the work category and specialty area of each; (3) assign employment codes to all filled and vacant cybersecurity positions based on the position's primary cybersecurity work category and specialty area; and (4) submit to the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) an annual report through 2021 that describes work categories and specialty areas of critical need and substantiates the critical need designations. DHS's Office of Cybersecurity Human Capital (OCHCO) developed departmental procedures in May 2014 and recommended implementation steps for coding positions with cybersecurity functions for the department's components.

The United States has a role in responding to climate change, including as a driver of migration. Executive Order 13653, issued in March 2017, directed the agencies to develop integrated country strategies that integrate consideration of climate change into agency operations and overall mission objectives. Executive Order 13677, issued in September 2016, directed the agencies to incorporate climate-resilience considerations into decision making by assessing climate-related risks to agency strategies, among other things. GAO was asked to review the extent to which State, USAID, and DOD have discussed the potential effects of climate change on migration in their plans and risk assessments. This report (1) describes executive branch actions related to climate change and migration from fiscal years 2014 through 2018; (2) examines the extent to which State, USAID, and DOD have discussed the potential effects of climate change on migration in their plans and risk assessments; and (3) describes State, USAID, and DOD activities, if any, that are related to climate change and global migration. GAO reviewed documents from the current and previous administrations and interviewed officials from State, USAID, and DOD. What GAO Found The Departments of State (State), the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), and Defense (DOD) are among the U.S. government agencies with a role in responding to issues related to climate change, including as a driver of migration. State interacts with foreign governments and international organizations focused on climate change and migration primarily through the Bureau of Oceans and International Environmental and Scientific Affairs (State/OES) and the Bureau of Population, Refugees, and Migration (State/PRM).

    "gao_GAO-19-141": "Why GAO Did This Study Medicare pays long-term care hospitals (LTCH) for care provided to Medicare beneficiaries. Two qualifying hospitals\u2014Craig Hospital and Shepherd Center\u2014are among the most common LTCHs in the United States. GAO was asked to review Medicare payments to these two hospitals. This report examines (1) the extent to which Medicare payments to the two qualifying hospitals are consistent with Medicare payment policies, and (2) similarities and differences between the two hospitals and other facilities that treat Medicare patients with spinal cord and brain injuries. GAO analyzed Medicare claims data and other information from fiscal year 2013 through fiscal year 2016, and interviewed officials from CMS and the Medicare Payment Advisory Commission (MedPAC), among others. GAO also reviewed Medicare claims data and other information from CMS and the Medicare Payment Advisory Commission. What GAO Found GAO found that most Medicare beneficiaries at the two qualifying hospitals need specialized services to manage the chronic, long-term effects of a catastrophic spinal cord or brain injury. Most of these patients are younger than 65 and ineligible for Medicare at the time of their initial injury, according to officials from the qualifying hospitals. Instead, according to officials, these patients typically become eligible for Medicare 2 years or more after their initial injury due to disability. The two qualifying hospitals\u2014Craig Hospital and Shepherd Center\u2014received payments at the standard rate, which is a lower rate than the average comparable acute care rate for all Medicare discharges. However, GAO found that the two hospitals would receive some payments at the standard rate, but that most of their discharges would be paid at the lower, site-neutral rate\u2014assuming similar caseloads (e.g., patient mix). In addition, officials from both qualifying hospitals and some stakeholders GAO interviewed noted that payment policies may result in fewer services provided and fewer patients served by the qualifying hospitals and other LTCHs. For example, officials from Craig Hospital told GAO they stopped providing post-operative care to patients requiring spinal surgery, such as patients with syringomyelia, in 2016\u2014instead referring them to other facilities\u2014in part because these discharges do not meet the criteria for the standard rate. As of September 2018, they do not plan to provide this care in the future unless the temporary exception is extended. The two qualifying hospitals treat patients with different conditions than most of those treated at other LTCHs, and treat fewer Medicare beneficiaries.",

This statement summarizes GAO's ongoing work on these three projects and discusses lessons learned from NASA acquisitions. This statement is based on ongoing work on NASA's major space telescope projects and ongoing work on NASA's major space telescope projects. GAO's ongoing work includes reviewing NASA's acquisitions and analyzing NASA's acquisition policies and procedures. GAO's ongoing work also includes reviewing NASA's acquisition plans and cost and schedule estimates for the three projects. What GAO Found The National Aeronautics and Space Administration's (NASA) current portfolio of major space telescopes includes three projects\u2014WFIRST, TESS, and JWST\u2014that vary in cost, complexity, and phase of the acquisition life cycle. WFIRST is in the earliest stages of the acquisition life cycle. With preliminary cost estimates ranging from $3.2 billion to $3.8 billion, this project is an observatory designed to perform wide-field imaging and survey of the sky at near-infrared wavelengths to answer questions about the structure and evolution of the universe and to expand our knowledge of planets beyond our solar system. The current design includes a 2.4 meter telescope that was built and qualified for another federal agency over 10 years ago; the project is evaluating which components to reuse and which to modify, refurbish, or build new. TESS is in the second stage of the acquisition life cycle. The project is currently holding cost and schedule reserves consistent with NASA center requirements, but there are no longer headquarters-held cost reserves to cover a delay if the project cannot launch as planned in March 2018. According to a project official, the project is holding 16 days of schedule reserve to its target March 2018 launch readiness date, which includes 6 days for the completion of integration and test, and 10 days for launch operations. The JWST project continues to make progress towards launch, but the program is encountering technical challenges that require both time and money to fix and may lead to additional delays, beyond a delay recently announced. While the project has made much progress on hardware integration and testing over the past several months, it also used all of its remaining schedule reserves to address various technical issues, particularly on the spacecraft element",

CFIUS reviews certain foreign acquisitions, mergers, or takeovers of U.S. businesses to determine the effect of the transaction on the national security of the United States. GAO was asked to review CFIUS. This report (1) examines changes in CFIUS workload and staffing from 2011 through 2016, and (2) provides information on stakeholder views on potential changes to CFIUS. GAO reviewed relevant laws, executive orders, and regulations; analyzed CFIUS workload and staffing data from 2011 through 2016; and interviewed CFIUS member agency officials and external experts. What GAO Found The Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS) has experienced an increase in workload in recent years, but Treasury, as CFIUS lead, has not coordinated member agency efforts to better understand staffing levels needed to complete core committee functions. According to CFIUS member agency officials, the volume of transactions notified to CFIUS and the complexity of CFIUS reviews in terms of technology, transaction structure, and national security concerns have increased substantially from 2011 through 2016, while CFIUS staffing levels have experienced a modest increase during the same time period. Member agency officials stated that CFIUS is able to review all transactions that have been voluntarily notified to the committee. However, many stakeholders, including most member agency officials and several external experts, expressed concerns that CFIUS member agencies were limited in their ability to complete other CFIUS functions, such as identifying non-notified transactions. In addition, agency officials were unsure if they would have sufficient staff if the CFIUS workload were to continue to increase. Standards for Internal Control in the Federal Government states that management should establish the organizational structure necessary to achieve its objectives and periodically evaluate this structure. Treasury, as CFIUS lead, has not coordinated member agency efforts to better understand the staffing levels needed to complete the current and future workload associated with core functions of the committee.

    "gao_GAO-18-107": "Why GAO Did This Study SIV holders are special immigrants who have worked for the U.S. government in Iraq or Afghanistan and are treated like refugees for purposes of federal public assistance, including receipt of resettlement assistance. GAO was asked to review SIV holders' experiences in the United States. This report examines (1) the extent to which SIV holders have experienced short-term outcomes and long-term outcomes, (2) the challenges SIV holders face in resettling in the United States, and (3) the extent to which ORR has provided targeted assistance to SIV holders. GAO analyzed data from the Department of State's Bureau of Population, Refugees, and Migration (PRM) for fiscal years 2011 through 2017 and interviewed officials from national and local resettlement agencies, advocacy groups, and other stakeholders. GAO also conducted 11 focus groups with SIV holders in four states selected based on geographic diversity and other factors. What GAO Found Limited data from PRM from fiscal year 2011 through part of fiscal year 2017 showed that most principal special immigrant visa (SIV) holders were unemployed and relied on cash assistance for income 90 days after arrival to the United States. The most recent data from one of its programs, the Matching Grant program, showed that most SIV holders were employed 6 months after arrival and no longer reliant on cash assistance. Although ORR regularly surveys the general refugee population up to 5 years after resettlement in order to examine their longer-term outcomes, it has never surveyed SIV holders for such information. SIV holders faced a variety of challenges while resettling in the United States, according to representatives of 13 local resettlement agencies GAO interviewed and SIV holders who participated in 11 focus groups. Among local resettlement agencies, the two in Northern Virginia reported significant challenges with their capacity to assist the large numbers of SIV holders in the area, while agencies in other locations GAO visited reported fewer capacity challenges. SIV holders also experienced challenges finding skilled employment, which did not align with their expectations of resettlement in the United States. Additionally, securing affordable and suitable housing, and female spouses' assimilation to U.S. culture were reported challenges. Officials GAO interviewed from some resettlement agencies reported taking steps to address some of these issues.",

WMATA's workforce is composed of bus and rail operations staff, as well as managers, administrators, law enforcement, and others. GAO was asked to review WMATA's workforce costs. This report assesses (1) how WMATA's workforce costs have changed from fiscal years 2006 through 2017 and factors contributing to those changes; (2) how WMATA identifies and addresses its current and future workforce needs; and (3) how WMATA has designed, implemented, and monitored its employee performance management systems. GAO analyzed WMATA's budget and annual audited financial statements from fiscal years 2006 through 2017, and interviewed WMATA officials and union leaders. What GAO Found The Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority's (WMATA) total workforce costs\u2014composed of wages, salaries, and benefits for current and retired employees\u2014increased modestly in inflation-adjusted fiscal year 2017 dollars, with wages and salaries increasing an average 1.1 percent per year, from $645 million in 2006 to $728 million in 2017. These costs grew at a slower rate than the costs of contracted services (7.3 percent annually on average) and employee and retiree benefits (5.6 percent annually on average). WMATA officials attributed these increases to several factors, including increasing ridership and the cost of providing paratransit service. WMATA's pension plans, due to their relative size and maturity and investment decisions, pose a particular risk to WMATA's financial operations: Relative size and maturity: WMATA's pension plans are large relative to its business operations, and the size of the plans' participants poses a combined financial risk to WMATA. WMATA officials told GAO that WMATA has not fully assessed the risks of its pension plans to the agency's financial operations. Without a comprehensive assessment of these risks, WMATA and its stakeholders\u2014such as its Board of Directors\u2014are limited in their ability to prepare for economic scenarios that could ultimately increase the amount WMATA is required to contribute to its pension plans. WMATA identifies the staffing levels it needs each year through its annual budgeting process, but does not have a strategic process to identify and address its long-term workforce needs to meet the agency's goals.",
    "gao_GAO-18-470": "Why GAO Did This Study The President issued two executive orders addressing border security and immigration enforcement on January 25, 2017. The orders direct executive branch agencies to implement a series of reporting, policy, and programmatic provisions to carry out the administration's border security and immigration policies and priorities. The President also issued Executive Order 13780, which directed agencies to take various actions to improve the screening and vetting protocols and procedures associated with the visa-issuance process and the U.S. Refugee Admissions Program. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2018, was signed into law on March 23, 2018, providing funding for government operations for the remainder of fiscal year 2018. GAO was asked to review the implementation of the executive orders. This report examines (1) the extent to which DHS, DOJ, and State have implemented the executive orders and the resources they have used to implement them, and (2) the extent to which DHS, DOJ, and State have implemented the executive orders and the resources they have used to implement them. GAO reviewed executive orders and related documents and interviewed agency officials. GAO also reviewed budgetary data and budgetary data from agencies' internal data systems. What GAO Found The Departments of Homeland Security (DHS), Justice (DOJ), and State (State) took initial planning and programmatic actions in response to the President's executive orders on border security and immigration enforcement. DHS, DOJ, and State issued reports, developed or revised policies, and took initial planning and programmatic actions in response to the executive orders. Each agency took a distinct approach to implementing the orders based on its organizational structure and the scope of its responsibilities. Each executive order established near-term reporting requirements for agencies, including updates on the status of their efforts, studies to inform planning and implementation, and reports for the public. DHS, DOJ, and State used existing fiscal year 2017 resources to support initial actions. For example, DHS reported expending approximately $4.2 million detailing asylum officers to immigration detention facilities along the southern border from February 2017 through February 2018. Additionally, as a result of the 120-day suspension of refugee admissions, State cancelled airline tickets for previously approved refugee applicants, which resulted in a cost of nearly $2.4 million in cancellation and unused ticket fees. DHS, DOJ, and State used existing fiscal year 2017 resources to support initial actions. For example, DHS's U.S. Customs",

DOD has proposed reducing the time it takes to award contracts in order to address concerns that it is taking too long. GAO was asked to evaluate the length of time taken to award contracts. This report examines (1) DOD's efforts to determine the time it takes to award weapon systems contracts; (2) what available data show regarding the time between solicitation issuance and award for selected weapon systems-related contracts; and (3) factors identified as contributing to contract award time frames. GAO analyzed DOD contract data for a nongeneralizable sample of 129 weapon systems-related contracts, surveyed DOD contracting officials for 60 of these contracts, and interviewed DOD officials and industry representatives. What GAO Found The Department of Defense (DOD) components in GAO's review have efforts underway to track and reduce the time to award contracts, but these efforts are not coordinated across the department. DOD components collect information on the time to award contracts, but differ on what information they collect and how they use it. DOD is taking a number of actions to understand the information the components collect such as determining what events are tracked, but DOD does not have a department-wide strategy for collecting and assessing the components' information. DOD has proposed reducing the length of time to award contracts by as much as 50 percent, as measured from the receipt of the requirements to contract award. DOD officials stated that they are starting to identify events common across the components, relative to contract award time frames. Without a strategy for data collection and assessment, DOD will be limited in its ability to assess progress toward achieving its proposed goal and addressing challenges across components. GAO's review of a nongeneralizable sample of 129 weapon systems-related contracts had a wide range of time intervals from solicitation issuance to award. The time intervals from solicitation to award ranged from less than a month to more than 4 years, with a median of about 9 months. Based on GAO's analysis, 88 of the 129 contracts were awarded less than a year from the solicitation issuance date, while 38 were awarded between 1 and 2 years. The remaining 3 selected contracts took more than 2 years to award. DOD contracting",

RFA also requires the regulators to review the burden of regulations they administer to minimize any significant economic impact on small entities. This statement discusses (1) the burden of regulations that federal regulators consider when developing regulations and (2) the results of recent EGRPRA reviews and the extent to which the regulators have reviewed the burden of regulations. This statement is based on GAO's February 2018 report, Regulatory Flexibility Act: Federal Reserve, Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, and Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (GAO-2018-02-282). GAO reviewed RFA requirements, analyzed 66 certifications by six regulators, and interviewed regulators and others. What GAO Found The Federal Reserve, Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, and Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) conducted a regulatory flexibility analysis that included an initial assessment of the rule's potential impact on small entities and described any significant alternatives to reduce the rule's significant economic impact on small entities while achieving statutory objectives. However, GAO found several weaknesses with the regulators' analyses, policies, and procedures that could undermine the goal of RFA and limit transparency and public accountability. For example, in most (43 of 66) certifications, the regulators provided a factual basis and concluded the rule would not apply to small entities or have any economic impact. However, the factual basis provided for most of the 18 certifications lacked key components recommended by the Office of Advocacy and the Office of Management and Budget. For example, in 18 of 66 certifications, the regulators concluded the rule would have some economic impact on small entities, but concluded the impact would not be significant for a substantial number of small entities. But the factual basis provided for most of the 18 certifications lacked key components recommended by the Office of Advocacy and the Office of Management and Budget. For example, in 15 of 18 certifications, regulators did not describe or fully describe their methodology or data sources for their conclusions. By not fully assessing potential economic effects or alternatives, regulators may not be fully realizing the opportunity to minimize unnecessary burdens on small entities, which is the primary goal of RFA.

The United States is also the largest buyer of petroleum products refined in the United States. Mexico is also a major buyer of petroleum products refined in the United States. U.S. agencies have a role in energy integration efforts. GAO was asked to review U.S. energy integration efforts. This report examines (1) ways in which the U.S., Canadian, and Mexican governments cooperate on North American energy integration; (2) U.S. agencies' activities to facilitate North American energy integration; (3) U.S. agencies' efforts to coordinate among themselves on North American energy integration; (4) ways in which U.S. agencies obtain feedback and input from U.S. industry and civil society regarding North American energy integration; and (5) steps that U.S., Canadian, and Mexican officials suggested to further facilitate North American energy integration. GAO reviewed documents and interviewed officials from the Departments of Energy (DOE), the Interior (Interior), Commerce (Commerce), State (State), Transportation (DOT), and the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC), and the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID). GAO also surveyed U.S. agencies' energy integration activities implemented from 2014 through 2017. What GAO Found U.S., Canadian, and Mexican governments cooperate on energy integration, although some strategic efforts have made limited progress. At the presidential level, trilateral cooperation has occurred mainly through the North American Leaders' Summit, where the leaders of the three countries discuss economic issues, including energy, according to U.S. government officials. The last summit was in 2016, and as of April 2018 a future summit had not been scheduled. At the agency level, U.S. officials and their counterparts in Mexico and Canada cooperate technically to address specific issues related to North American energy integration. U.S. agencies reported 81 activities related to North American energy integration from 2014 through 2017, according to agency officials. Some of these activities had multiple purposes or goals, such as technical discussions and assistance, regulatory cooperation, international agreements and other instruments, trade promotion, and research and development. For example, DOE and Interior have cooperated on energy efficiency standards and have developed a framework for energy integration. DOT has engaged in a number of energy-related trade missions to Mexico and Canada.",

Specifically, these systems are highly complex and dynamic, technologically diverse, and often geographically dispersed. This complexity increases the difficulty in identifying, managing, and protecting the numerous operating systems, applications, and devices comprising the systems and networks. Compounding the risk, federal systems and networks are also often interconnected with other internal and external systems and networks, including the Internet. As systems become more integrated, cyber threats will pose an increasing risk to national security, economic well-being, and public health and safety. GAO has designated information security as a government-wide high-risk area since 1997. In February 2017, GAO reported that the federal government's efforts to address information security deficiencies had fully met one of the five criteria for removal from the High-Risk List\u2014leadership commitment\u2014and partially met the other four, as shown in the figure below. GAO plans to update its assessment of this high-risk area against the five criteria in February 2019. Until GAO's recommendations are addressed and actions are taken to address the four challenges GAO identified, the federal government, the national critical infrastructure, and the personal information of U.S. citizens will be increasingly susceptible to the multitude of cyber-related threats that exist. This report (1) identifies the major cybersecurity challenges facing the federal government and other entities, (2) assesses the extent to which the federal government has implemented GAO's recommendations to address these challenges, and (3) assesses the extent to which the federal government has implemented GAO's recommendations to address these challenges. To do this, GAO analyzed relevant federal laws, regulations, and guidance; reviewed relevant federal laws, regulations, and guidance; and interviewed officials from federal agencies, industry, and academic organizations. What GAO Found Based on prior work, GAO has identified four major cybersecurity challenges: (1) establishing a comprehensive cybersecurity strategy and performing effective oversight, (2) securing federal systems and information, (3) protecting cyber critical infrastructure, and (4) protecting privacy and sensitive data. To address these challenges, GAO has identified 10 critical actions that the federal government and other entities need to take.

TSA, within the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), has primary responsibility for physical security and cybersecurity of pipeline systems. GAO was asked to review TSA's pipeline security program. This report examines (1) the extent to which pipeline operators address physical and cybersecurity risks and (2) the extent to which TSA assesses pipeline security risks and conducts security reviews. GAO reviewed TSA's Pipeline Security Guidelines and other documents, and interviewed TSA officials and 10 pipeline operators selected based on their pipeline industry and other factors. What GAO Found The Transportation Security Administration's (TSA) Pipeline Security Branch (PSA) issued its voluntary Pipeline Security Guidelines in 2011, but the guidelines lack a documented process to ensure that revisions occur and fully capture updates to supporting standards and guidance. Pipeline operators that GAO interviewed reported using a range of guidelines and standards to address their physical and cybersecurity risks, and all of them reported implementing TSA's voluntary Pipeline Security Guidelines that were applicable to their operations. However, TSA's guidelines do not include a documented process to consider the need to update the guidelines on a regular basis. Without a documented process defining how frequently Pipeline Security Branch staff are to review and revise its guidelines, TSA cannot ensure that its guidelines reflect the latest known standards and best practices for physical and cybersecurity, or address the persistent and dynamic security threat environment currently facing the nation's pipeline system.

DOD's business systems are generally required to meet certain criteria, such as estimating costs and material management and accounting. DOD also conducts incurred cost audits to eliminate the incurred cost audit backlog. The National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2017 included a provision for GAO to review DOD's business system reviews. This report examines (1) DOD's actions to clarify the roles and responsibilities of DCMA and DCAA in conducting business system reviews and consolidate the number of reviews to be performed; (2) what criteria are used to evaluate a contractor's business system; (3) establish timeframes by which Administrative Contracting Officers (ACO) are to make a determination on the adequacy of the contractors' business systems; and (4) implement the use of payment withholds for contractors that are found to have significant deficiencies in their contractor business systems. GAO reviewed six selected contractors' business system reviews and interviewed officials from DCMA and DCAA. What GAO Found Since 2011, the Department of Defense (DOD) has taken actions to (1) clarify the roles and responsibilities of Defense Contract Management Agency (DCMA) and Defense Contract Audit Agency (DCAA) in conducting business system reviews and consolidate the number of reviews to be performed; (2) clarify how often DOD should conduct CBS reviews; (3) establish what criteria are used to evaluate a contractor's business system; (4) establish timeframes by which ACOs are to make a determination on the adequacy of the contractors' business systems; and (5) implement the use of payment withholds for contractors that are found to have significant deficiencies in their contractor business systems. DCMA and DCAA officials noted that these changes were implemented primarily to address the 2011 statutory provisions. GAO's review of six selected contractors' business system reviews found that the whole process from the review or audit, to the follow up and resolution, can be lengthy. In three out of six selected cases GAO reviewed, it took 4 or more years for a contractor's system to be approved. Factors contributing to the time it took to resolve these issues included contractors submitting inadequate corrective action plans, DCMA or DCAA identifying additional deficiencies in subsequent reviews or audits, and the use of different auditors to conduct the",
    "gao_GAO-19-76": "Why GAO Did This Study DOT has the authority to enforce consumer protections for airline passengers. DOT has issued consumer protection regulations since 2009, and it has conducted almost 2,500 investigations and issued about 400 consent orders. GAO was asked to review DOT's efforts to ensure airlines' compliance with consumer protection requirements. This report (1) describes trends in DOT data on airline service from 2008 through 2017 and airlines' actions to improve service; (2) assesses how effectively DOT ensures airlines' compliance with consumer protection requirements; and (3) assesses the extent to which DOT's airline passenger education efforts align with key practices for consumer outreach. GAO analyzed DOT data on airline service from 2008 through 2017, reviewed DOT documents and data, and interviewed DOT officials. What GAO Found The Department of Transportation's (DOT) data, which include both operational measures of airline service and passenger complaints received by DOT, provide mixed information on whether service improved from 2008 through 2017. DOT requires reporting airlines to provide operational data, including information on late, cancelled, or diverted flights; mishandled baggage; and denied boardings. These data showed some general improvement in the quality of airline service from 2008 through 2017, but during the same time period, the total number of passenger complaints filed with DOT increased for \"selected\" airlines. Moreover, while these data may be imperfect measures of service quality, they do provide some indication of the passenger experience. DOT promotes and monitors airlines' compliance with consumer protection requirements and deters noncompliance in five key ways, such as by reviewing passenger complaint data and taking enforcement action where it identifies violations. However, GAO found that DOT could improve its procedures to provide additional assurances that analysts consistently code passengers' complaints and properly identify potential consumer protection violations, in addition to more fully utilizing data from DOT's information systems to inform its compliance program. DOT has five objectives for its key compliance activities, but it lacks performance measures for three of these objectives. DOT officials stated that they have not developed performance measures to monitor progress toward achievement of some objectives because it is difficult to develop quantifiable performance measures. DOT has taken positive steps to educate passengers about their rights\u2014through its revamped website and other educational resources.

These restrictions have been enacted through annual appropriations acts through fiscal year 2018. GAO was asked to review the restrictions on promoting tobacco exports. This report examines (1) the guidance select U.S. agencies have issued to implement funding restrictions on promoting tobacco exports overseas, (2) to what extent overseas officials from select U.S. agencies were aware of the restrictions and guidance, and (3) to what extent select U.S. agencies have implemented this guidance overseas. GAO reviewed U.S. appropriations laws that prohibited the funds appropriated therein from being used to promote the sale or export of U.S. tobacco or tobacco products since the 1990s, and guidance issued by State, Commerce, and USDA. GAO also interviewed officials in headquarters from State, Commerce, and USDA about post officials' implementation of guidance regarding the restrictions and guidance, and the types of questions they receive from post officials about the restrictions and guidance. GAO also reviewed agency documents and interviewed officials in headquarters from State, Commerce, and USDA about post officials' implementation of guidance regarding the restrictions and guidance. What GAO Found The Departments of State (State), Commerce (Commerce), and Agriculture (USDA) collaborate with each other to develop and periodically issue an interagency guidance cable to implement funding restrictions on promoting tobacco. According to officials, this cable serves as the primary source of guidance for implementing the restrictions on promoting tobacco. State has updated and issued the cable four times since 2013 to address changes in tobacco technology and other emerging issues, according to officials at these agencies. Commerce relies on both the interagency guidance cable and its client eligibility policy to implement restrictions on promoting tobacco. USDA relies on the interagency guidance cable to provide direction to its officials overseas, and does not have agency-specific guidance for implementing its permanent funding restrictions on promoting tobacco. USDA officials said that the cable sufficiently addresses the restrictions on the agency's promotion activities and helps to ensure that all officials serving at posts overseas conduct activities in a consistent manner. Most State, Commerce, and USDA officials overseas GAO interviewed were aware of the restrictions on promoting tobacco. Most officials GAO interviewed had received some guidance concerning the restrictions, but several officials did not recall receiving the interagency guidance cable.",

This report (1) describes what led the Coast Guard to the decision to terminate further IHiS development, and how much was spent on the project; (2) evaluates the Coast Guard's management and oversight actions for the discontinued EHR modernization project and what, if any, lessons learned were identified; (3) describes the Coast Guard's current process for managing health records and the challenges, if any, it is encountering; and (4) determines the Coast Guard's plans for effectively implementing a new EHR system and the current status of its efforts. GAO reviewed relevant Coast Guard policies and guidance, surveyed all 12 HSWL Regional Managers, and interviewed agency officials.

The Coast Guard's Executive Oversight Council (EOC) decided to cancel the project in October 2015, citing financial, technical, schedule, and personnel risks. The Coast Guard's Deputy Commandant for Mission Support, who was appointed to the position in August 2015, stated that the agency had incurred financial, technical, schedule, and personnel risks. The Coast Guard also attributed IHiS termination to the agency's decision to cancel the project and decommissioned two other Coast Guard systems. The Coast Guard's Deputy Commandant for Mission Support also stated that the agency continued to pay millions of dollars to vendors over 2 years after the project's cancelation to satisfy existing contractual obligations. The Coast Guard could not demonstrate that it effectively managed and oversaw the IHiS project prior to its discontinuance. Specifically, although the Coast Guard was to follow the Coast Guard's Command, Control, Communications, Computers and Information Technology (C4&IT) System Development Life Cycle (SDLC) Practice Manual to guide its management and oversight of the project, the agency could not provide complete evidence that it had addressed 15 of the 30 SDLC practices GAO selected for evaluation. In addition, project team members provided inconsistent explanations",
    "gao_GAO-18-303": "Why GAO Did This Study In fiscal year 2016, FWS awarded $1.5 billion in grants, which was about 50 percent of the agency's total $2.9 billion budget authority. Within FWS, WSFR is responsible for awarding most of the grant funding available from FWS, and in fiscal year 2016, WSFR awarded $1.2 billion in grants. GAO was asked to review WSFR's grant programs. This report (1) describes and describes the competitive grant programs that WSFR awards and monitors; (2) examines how WSFR awards grants under these programs and the extent to which this is consistent with relevant federal regulations; and (3) examines how WSFR monitors grants under these programs and the extent to which this is consistent with relevant federal regulations. GAO reviewed relevant federal laws and regulations, agency guidance, and documents and interviewed agency officials. GAO also reviewed a non-generalizable sample of grant documents for fiscal year 2015, selected based on the number of applications received and the number of projects selected from the applications. What GAO Found The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (WSFR) awards and monitors five competitive grant programs, according to agency documents and officials GAO interviewed. These five grant programs are (1) the Boating Infrastructure Tier 2 Grant Program, (2) the Clean Vessel Act Grant Program, (3) the Competitive State Wildlife Grant Program, (4) the Multistate Conservation Grant Program, and (5) the National Coastal Wetlands Conservation Grant Program. While these grant programs support different types of projects, they generally are funded from the Sport Fish Restoration and Boating Trust Fund, and most require non-federal matching funds from the grant recipient based on statute. The award process WSFR uses for the five competitive grant programs GAO reviewed generally involves announcing the grant opportunity and reviewing applications to make award decisions, and in some cases federal agencies or third parties are involved in these activities. The award process used for the five competitive WSFR grant programs is generally consistent with federal grant regulations in the Uniform Administrative Requirements, Cost Principles, and Audit Requirements for Federal Awards (Uniform Guidance). Specifically, the Uniform Guidance requires that grant funding opportunities be publicly announced and that the Notice of Funding Opportunity (NOFO) contains certain information, including the criteria and process used to evaluate applications. The NOFOs contained criteria for scoring applications that matched the criteria in program-specific regulations",
    "gao_GAO-18-648": "Why GAO Did This Study VA is responsible for providing health care to about 9 million veterans at 172 medical centers. In June 2016, the Supreme Court ruled that VA must restrict competition to veteran-owned small businesses if the contracting officer reasonably expects that at least two such businesses will submit offers and that award can be made at a fair and reasonable price that offers the best value to the government. GAO was asked to review VA's implementation of the Veterans First program. This report assesses (1) how VA procurement obligations to veteran-owned small businesses changed in the period from fiscal years 2014 through 2017, (2) what actions VA has taken to update Veterans First policies and regulations and provide training following the Supreme Court's decision, (3) what challenges, if any, VA is encountering in applying Veterans First policies, and (4) the extent to which VA has mechanisms in place to monitor compliance with subcontracting limitations by veteran-owned small businesses, and the effectiveness of such mechanisms. GAO analyzed VA contract data from fiscal years 2014 through 2017, reviewed VA policies and regulations, and interviewed VA contracting officials. What GAO Found The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) has set aside a much greater percentage of service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses (SD/VOSB) contracts and orders than for other types of goods and services. The number of SD/VOSBs certified by VA also increased, as did the number of those firms that received contract awards. VA has updated its Veterans First program policy and provided training to contracting officers following the Supreme Court decision. VA's Office of Procurement Policy addressed some aspects of the 2016 Veterans First policy that had caused confusion and concerns among contracting officers by providing additional guidance and policy. Contracting officers GAO interviewed expressed dissatisfaction with the VA Rule of Two, which determines whether there is a reasonable expectation that two or more SD/VOSBs will submit offers and that award can be made at a fair and reasonable price that offers best value to the government. Contracting officers also expressed confusion about how to determine whether the prices offered by SD/VOSBs in response to a set-aside solicitation are fair and reasonable. VA contracting officers are generally required to make this determination for every contract award. However, GAO found that many of the contracting officers GAO interviewed were uncertain how to balance the Veterans First preference with the determination of fair and reasonable price when lower",

The U.S. Seaway Corporation manages two locks on the system, which are critical to the system's ability to transport cargo. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (Army Corps) and the U.S. Seaway Corporation have undertaken efforts to renew the locks. GAO was asked to review the status of the Great Lakes-Seaway system. This report examines (1) how Great Lakes-Seaway shipping trends have changed since 1980 and what factors have shaped recent trends, (2) selected stakeholders' perspectives on challenges to using the Great Lakes-Seaway, and (3) to what extent the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and the U.S. Seaway Corporation have made progress on lock infrastructure renewal efforts and how the agencies measure performance of these efforts. GAO analyzed data from both agencies and reviewed relevant documents and interviewed officials from the Army Corps, U.S. Seaway Corporation, and Customs and Border Protection. What GAO Found The amount of cargo transported annually on the Great Lakes-Seaway\u2014specifically for U.S. Great Lakes domestic and Seaway cargo\u2014has generally declined since 1980. The Great Lakes U.S. domestic \"laker\" cargo traffic declined from about 115 million tons in 1980 to about 78 million tons in 2016\u2014a decline of 32 percent. The St. Lawrence Seaway, which is primarily used by Canadian and foreign vessels, declined by 48 percent over the same time period, from about 74 million tons in 1980 to about 39 million tons in 2016, according to Seaway Traffic Data. Stakeholders identified various economic factors that have affected Great Lakes-Seaway cargo traffic levels since the 1980s, including trends in global prices for commodities such as grain, iron ore, and steel. Stakeholders also identified various challenges to using the Great Lakes-Seaway, including the annual winter closure, which is a key feature of the system. Stakeholders identified several challenges that affect traditional and emerging uses of the system, such as transport of dry bulk commodities and imported steel. For example, the U.S. Coast Guard has increased pilotage rates for foreign vessels operating in the Great Lakes-Se",
    "gao_GAO-18-57": "Why GAO Did This Study FAA is responsible for regulating the commercial space launch industry, which includes unmanned and manned vehicles and from the United States and overseas. FAA requires launch companies to purchase a MPL, which is intended to reflect the greatest dollar amount of loss to third parties and the federal government for bodily injury and property damage that can be reasonably expected from a launch or reentry accident. The Commercial Space Launch Act Amendments of 1988 established the foundation for the current U.S. policy to potentially provide federal payment for a portion of claims by third parties for injury, damage, or loss that results from a launch or reentry accident. GAO was asked to review FAA's MPL methodology. This report examines the extent to which FAA (1) evaluated its MPL methodology incorporating three requirements, (2) addressed previously identified weaknesses, and (3) updated its MPL methodology. GAO reviewed FAA's MPL methodology and interviewed agency officials. GAO also reviewed FAA's MPL methodology and interviewed launch providers and insurance companies. What GAO Found The Commercial Space Launch Act Amendments of 1988 required the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) to evaluate its MPL methodology incorporating three requirements, but the agency's report did not fully address these requirements. First, the act required FAA to ensure a balance of risk between launch companies and the federal government. However, agency officials told GAO that they did not re-evaluate the probability thresholds\u2014which are used to divide the risk of loss between launch companies and the federal government\u2014as part of evaluating its MPL methodology when implementing the risk profile method due to resource constraints. Second, the act required FAA to consider the cost impact of implementing an updated MPL methodology, but the agency did not evaluate the impact of implementing its revised methodology on the direct costs to launch companies and to the federal government. Third, the act required FAA to consult with the commercial space sector and insurance providers in evaluating its MPL methodology, but they did not consult such parties in response to the act. Without fully addressing CSLCA's mandated requirements, FAA cannot ensure that the federal government is not exposed to greater liability costs than intended or that launch companies are not required to purchase more insurance coverage than necessary. FAA obtained limited input from the commercial space sector and insurance providers in evaluating its MPL methodology, as required by the Commercial Space",
    "gao_GAO-18-701T": "Why GAO Did This Study In fiscal year 2017, EOIR, within the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), processed about 747,000 cases, and removed about 98 percent of these cases from the United States. EOIR is responsible for managing the immigration courts, which are the primary means of removing foreign nationals from the United States. This testimony discusses (1) the extent to which EOIR has faced long-standing management challenges and (2) the extent to which EOIR has established program performance measures to assess the ATD program. This statement is based on GAO reports issued from June 2017 through November 2014, selected updates conducted in February 2018, and selected updates conducted in April 2018. GAO analyzed EOIR data on case completion times, ATD participation, and removals from the United States. GAO also interviewed EOIR officials, immigration court staff, DHS attorneys, and other experts and stakeholders. What GAO Found GAO reported in June 2017 that the Immigration and Customs Enforcement's (ICE) annual immigration court system caseload\u2014the number of open cases before the court during a single fiscal year\u2014grew 44 percent from fiscal years 2006 through 2015 due to an increase in the case backlog, while case receipts remained steady and the immigration courts completed fewer cases. During this 10-year period, the case backlog grew from about 212,000 cases pending at the start of fiscal year 2006 to about 199,000 cases completed in 2015. During this 10-year period, the case backlog grew an average of 38,000 cases per year. GAO also reported in June 2017 that EOIR has faced long-standing management and operational challenges. In particular, GAO identified challenges related to EOIR's workforce planning, hiring, and technology utilization, among other things. EOIR generally concurred and has initiated actions to address GAO's recommendations. However, EOIR needs to take additional steps to fully implement GAO's recommendations to help strengthen the agency's management and reduce the case backlog. For example, in June 2017, GAO reported that EOIR estimated staffing needs using an informal approach that did not account for long-term staffing needs, reflect EOIR's performance goals, or account for differences in the complexity of court cases. GAO recommended that EOIR (1) assess the immigration judge hiring process to identify opportunities for efficiency; (2) use the assessment results to develop a hiring strategy targeting short",
    "gao_GAO-18-487": "Why GAO Did This Study CBP is responsible for securing the U.S. border and securing the nation's borders. CBP has experienced a loss of more than a third of its officers in recent years, and CBP's ability to retain qualified law enforcement personnel has been challenged. GAO was asked to review CBP's recruitment, hiring, and retention of law enforcement personnel. This report examines (1) CBP's efforts to recruit, hire, and retain law enforcement personnel and (2) CBP's retention of law enforcement personnel. GAO reviewed relevant laws, regulations, and guidance; analyzed CBP data on law enforcement officer hiring and retention; and interviewed CBP officials. What GAO Found The Department of Homeland Security's (DHS) U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) has made progress in improving its recruitment, hiring, and retention of law enforcement personnel, including increasing the total number of applications it receives for these positions and reducing the amount of time it takes to hire applicants. CBP officials stated they established a centralized recruitment office in February 2016 to manage recruitment efforts across all three operational components\u2014the Office of Federal Operations (OFO), Border Patrol, and Air Interdiction Operations (AMO). CBP's recruitment budget allocated by the NFRC almost doubled from approximately $6.4 million in fiscal year 2015 to more than $12.7 million in fiscal year 2017. CBP officials stated that recruitment incentives have been effective in filling staffing shortages at hard-to-fill locations. CBP has also increased its use of recruitment incentives from fiscal years 2015 through 2017, but 14 of the 18 locations where these incentives are used have not experienced a decrease in staffing levels as of February 2018. CBP has taken steps to improve its hiring process for law enforcement officers, but the process remains lengthy. CBP has made efforts to improve its hiring process for law enforcement officers by revising certain aspects of the process and piloting two key hiring initiatives\u2014Hiring Hub events and the Applicant Care program. According to agency officials, these efforts have collectively resulted in the decreased time-to-hire and increased overall applicant pass rates for all three components. CBP officials also stated that their ability to further improve CBP's time-to-hire and increase law enforcement hires is affected by hiring process steps that can be challenging and time-consuming for applicants to complete as well as C",
    "gao_GAO-18-163": "Why GAO Did This Study The federal government provides about $1.3 billion in federal student aid each year to help borrowers avoid default on their loans. The CDR is intended to hold schools accountable for borrowers who default within the first 3 years of repayment. GAO was asked to review the CDR. This report examines (1) how schools work with borrowers to manage their CDRs, and how these strategies affect borrowers and schools' accountability for defaults; and (2) the extent to which Education oversees the strategies schools and their default management consultants use to manage schools' CDRs and informs the public about its efforts to hold schools accountable. GAO analyzed Education data on borrowers who entered repayment in the 2009-2013 CDR cohorts and interviewed Education officials and nine default management consultants. GAO also reviewed relevant federal laws and regulations and interviewed officials from Education and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. What GAO Found To help manage their default rates, some schools hired default management consultants that encouraged borrowers with past-due student loans to postpone loan payments through forbearance, even when better borrower options may be available. The nine default management consultants GAO selected, which served over 1,300 schools, used various methods to contact borrowers and attempted to connect them with their loan servicer for assistance. The consultants GAO selected, which served over 1,300 schools, used various methods to contact borrowers and attempted to connect them with their loan servicer for assistance. Some consultants have an incentive to encourage forbearance in particular as a strategy to prevent borrowers from defaulting within the 3-year CDR period in an effort to lower their client schools' CDRs. However, some consultants have an incentive to encourage forbearance over other repayment or postponement options that may be more beneficial to borrowers. For example, one consultant offered borrowers gift cards as an incentive to put their loans in forbearance. While forbearance can be a useful tool for helping borrowers avoid defaulting on their loans in the short term, it increases their costs over time and reduces the usefulness of the CDR to hold schools accountable. For example, spending 18 months or more\u2014at least half of the CDR period\u2014in forbearance reduces the potential for borrowers to default within the 3-year period. This is because forbearance keeps borrowers current on their loans, and borrowers would not go into default until they",

In 2015, FEHBP enrollees paid about $88 billion in premiums and plan premiums. The program is administered by OPM, which is responsible for negotiating health benefits and premiums with FEHBP carriers. GAO was asked to review FEHBP enrollment and market share. This report examines (1) the number of available FEHBP plan offerings and the market share held by the largest carriers in each county, (2) the views of stakeholders on the potential effects of expanding OPM's contracting authority, and (3) the financial effects of expanding OPM's contracting authority. GAO analyzed FEHBP enrollment data from 2007 through 2015, reviewed relevant laws and regulations, and interviewed officials from OPM, the Department of Labor, and 10 stakeholders selected based on a range of FEHBP attributes, among other factors. What GAO Found The number of available Federal Employees Health Benefits Program (FEHBP) plan offerings generally increased from 2007 through 2015. In 99 percent of counties nationwide, enrollees had more plan offerings in 2015 than they had in 2007. The median number of plan offerings available in a county increased from 19 in 2007 to 24 in 2015. Most of these offerings were nationwide fee-for-service (FFS) plans that are available in all counties. There were 17 such plan offerings in 2007 and 19 in 2015. The remaining plan offerings were health maintenance organizations (HMO) that were available in more limited areas. While the total number of HMO plans that participated in FEHBP decreased from 2007 through 2015, the median number of HMO plan offerings in a county increased. This suggests that those HMO plans in FEHBP in 2015 generally participated in more counties than was the case in 2007. The share of the market held by the largest carrier in each county increased from a county median of 58 percent in 2000 to 70 percent in 2007, to 72 percent in 2015. Similarly, the combined median county market share of the three largest carriers in each county increased from 86 to 90 percent over the same time period. However, the median market share held by the second and third largest carriers generally decreased over time. This suggests that the increases in combined market share held by the three largest carriers were generally due to increases observed in the single largest carrier. Stakeholder opinions and cost",
    "gao_GAO-18-254": "Why GAO Did This Study Fintech firms are nontraditional providers of financial products and services that are offered to consumers. Fintech firms are not subject to routine federal oversight, but they may be subject to state oversight and enforcement. GAO was asked to review fintech. This report examines (1) the benefits and risks of fintech activities and (2) the extent to which fintech firms are subject to federal oversight. GAO reviewed literature and interviewed federal and state regulators, consumer advocates, and other stakeholders. GAO also reviewed relevant federal laws and regulations and interviewed regulators and market participants. What GAO Found Fintech products can provide consumers and the broader financial system with various benefits, but may also pose risks similar to those of traditional products. Fintech products can provide consumers with greater convenience, lower cost, increased financial inclusion, faster services, and improved security. For example, consumers can use fintech products and services on their mobile devices to make payments; transfer money; easily obtain payment for shared expenses; obtain loans; or receive investment advice without the time and expense of visiting a financial service provider's physical location. Fintech products also pose risks similar to those of traditional products, such as fraud, discrimination, and unsuitable advice. While existing laws apply to fintech products and services in most cases, some fintech products pose additional risks that may not be sufficiently addressed by existing laws. For example, some fintech products pose additional risks that may not be sufficiently addressed by existing laws. While the legal framework for consumer protection applies to many of the risks associated with fintech products, the extent to which consumers benefit from these protections is a function of the existing regulatory framework and its coverage of fintech activity. Fintech firms' compliance with applicable consumer or other laws varied. Fintech firms that offer investment advice typically register with and are subject to examinations by federal securities regulators. Some fintech firms providing payments or loans that have partnered with federally regulated banks or credit unions may receive indirect oversight from federal financial regulators as part of their efforts to ensure that their regulated entities are adequately managing the risks of these arrangements. Nonpartnered fintech firms would not typically be subject to routine examinations by a federal financial regulator but would instead be subject to state regulatory oversight and enforcement. While fintech firms and financial institutions are subject to different degrees of routine federal oversight, GAO found that indications of fintech firms causing widespread harm were limited as they were subject to fewer complaints",
    "gao_GAO-18-116": "Why GAO Did This Study The Kissell Amendment, as amended, requires DHS to procure textiles from foreign sources. The Kissell Amendment also includes multiple exceptions to the procurement restriction, including small purchases, availability, de minimis, and availability exceptions. Senate Report 1619, a bill related to the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2016, included a provision for GAO to review DHS's implementation and compliance with the Kissell Amendment. This report examines the extent to which (1) DHS has incorporated the Kissell Amendment into its procurement policies and procedures and (2) the Kissell Amendment affects DHS's procurement of textiles. GAO reviewed relevant laws and policies, analyzed DHS contract files, and interviewed DHS officials. What GAO Found The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) updated its procurement regulations to incorporate the Kissell Amendment restriction on the procurement of textiles from foreign sources. Since then, DHS inserted language incorporating the restriction into the 11 DHS textile contracts GAO reviewed. The HSAR establishes standardized DHS policies for all procurement activities within the department; according to DHS officials, all DHS components are to follow these policies. Pursuant to the Kissell Amendment, the restriction on the procurement of textiles became effective for DHS on August 16, 2009. One day later, DHS published an interim rule with a request for comments from the public that amended relevant HSAR sections to reflect the statutory change limiting the procurement of products containing textiles from sources outside the United States (i.e., the Kissell Amendment). On June 9, 2010, after receiving comments from the public, DHS adopted the amendments as final and without change. DHS employs multiple procedures, according to officials, in an effort to ensure that the Kissell Amendment was and is properly applied, including (1) a standardized procurement contract review process; (2) a requirement for all DHS components to use established department-wide contracts; (3) verification procedures to ensure the stated country of origin is correct; and (4) trainings on foreign procurement restrictions. In practice, the Kissell Amendment affects DHS textile purchases in a limited manner due to multiple factors. For most DHS components, these factors limit the effect of the Kissell Amendment restriction to certain foreign textile procurements directly related to U.S. national security interests that fall between $150,000 and $191,000. Specifically, from October 2009",
    "gao_GAO-18-150": "Why GAO Did This Study HUD is responsible for overseeing the MTW demonstration, which is intended to identify successful approaches for public housing agencies nationwide. The MTW demonstration is on the brink of significant expansion, but HUD does not yet have the people, data, and processes in place to effectively oversee agency participants and assess the demonstration's performance and effects on tenants. GAO was asked to review the MTW demonstration. This report examines (1) steps HUD has taken to improve oversight of the MTW demonstration and (2) the extent to which HUD has a framework for monitoring the effect of rent-reform, work-requirement, and time-limit policies on tenants. GAO reviewed HUD documents and interviewed HUD officials and representatives from seven MTW agencies selected based on geographic diversity and other factors. What GAO Found Since GAO's last review of the MTW demonstration in April 2012, the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) has taken steps to improve MTW agencies' annual reporting and its process for monitoring agencies' compliance with requirements of the demonstration. However, HUD's oversight\u2014review of annual reports and compliance assessments\u2014has not been timely and HUD has not fully documented its process for assessing compliance, due to limited staffing and competing priorities. While the MTW Office added staff to assist with the oversight of the current 39 MTW agencies, HUD has not conducted workforce planning to address the resources needed for overseeing the 100 agencies to be added through the MTW demonstration expansion. GAO found significant differences between MTW agencies and comparable non-MTW agencies in key outcomes: MTW agencies had lower public housing occupancy rates, lower voucher unit utilization rates, and higher program expenses in 2009\u20132015 than comparable non-MTW agencies. MTW funding flexibilities may partly explain the differences, but limitations in HUD data (such as the inability to determine which funding source was used to fund which activity) make it difficult to more fully understand the differences. MTW agencies accumulated relatively large reserves of voucher funding, but HUD has performed limited oversight of reserves for these agencies. HUD's definition of rent reform is unclear, leading to agencies inconsistently categorizing some policies and not reporting required information for rent-reform activities. HUD guidance for analyzing rent-reform activities was not detailed, leading to inconsistent reporting and a lack",

GAO reviewed relevant OEC documents and interviewed OEC officials and 10 public-safety organizations that focus on various public-safety issues across federal, state, local, and tribal jurisdictions. What GAO Found The Office of Emergency Communications (OEC) and the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) have responsibilities for developing and implementing guidance for grantees using federal funds for interoperable emergency communications. OEC and FEMA officials told GAO FEMA is responsible for administering the grants, and OEC coordinates emergency communications grant guidance annually through the Statewide Interoperability Coordinators (SWIC) and the Public Safety Advisory Committee (PSAC). GAO reviewed OEC's and FEMA's collaborative efforts related to grant guidance and found that their efforts generally follow GAO's previously identified leading practices for effective interagency collaboration. OEC and FEMA officials told GAO that they participate in the SAFECOM Grants Focus Group, whose members coordinate across federal grant programs to support interoperable emergency communications. OEC and FEMA officials said they conduct emergency-communications-related trainings and briefings for FEMA at least once a year.

RRB conducts continuing disability reviews (CDR) to determine if beneficiaries continue to meet the disability requirements of the law. RRB also conducts earnings CDRs for beneficiaries detected with earnings that exceed program limits. GAO was asked to review RRB's CDR program. This report examines (1) the extent to which RRB conducts CDRs for beneficiaries with earnings that exceed program limits and (2) the extent to which RRB oversees its CDR program. GAO analyzed RRB data on CDRs completed from fiscal years 2014 through 2016 and reviewed RRB documents and data. GAO also interviewed RRB officials. What GAO Found The Railroad Retirement Board (RRB) completed 427 continuing disability reviews (CDR) for about 1 percent of the railroad workers who received disability benefits in fiscal years 2014-2016. Of the 427 CDRs completed, 209 were medical CDRs and 163 were earnings CDRs. Of the 427 CDRs completed, 209 were medical CDRs and 163 were earnings CDRs. Of the 43 CDRs completed during fiscal years 2014-2016, 3 ineligible beneficiaries were identified and 1 overpayment was identified and calculated. RRB developed criteria for conducting additional medical CDRs to target cases at high risk for fraud that could result in termination of benefits. However, these CDRs identified no ineligible beneficiaries and no overpayments. RRB officials acknowledged delays of a year or more in calculating overpayments identified through CDRs, and they lack a standard time frame for doing so. RRB has no plans to establish a standard time frame for processing overpayments identified through CDRs. RRB's oversight of its CDR program has focused on high-risk CDRs rather than overall program data. RRB's program evaluation and management services, which is tasked with conducting reviews to ensure efficient program performance, has conducted two internal reviews of the high-risk medical CDRs since they were first implemented in 2015. RRB officials said they plan to track certain annual measures for high-risk CDRs, such as the number of cases referred to the Office of Inspector General for potential fraud, CDR outcomes (continuances, suspensions, and terminations),",

IHS has agreements with tribes and tribal organizations by which it transfers a substantial portion of its budget authority to tribes and tribal organizations. GAO was asked to review IHS's health care system and tribal health care. This report examines (1) the extent to which IHS has advance appropriation authority for its health care programs, and (2) the potential effects of CRs and government shutdowns on the provision of IHS-funded health care services for AI/ANs. GAO reviewed relevant federal laws and regulations, and interviewed officials from IHS, VA, and the National Institutes of Health (NIHB), which represents AI/AN interests.

What GAO Found The Indian Health Service (IHS) provides health care services to members of federally recognized AI/AN tribes, primarily in rural areas on or near reservations. IHS provides services directly through a network of hospitals, clinics, and health stations operated by IHS, and also funds services provided at tribally operated facilities. As of October 2017, IHS, tribes, and tribal organizations operated 168 service units, 48 hospitals, and 560 ambulatory care centers\u2014including health centers, school health centers, health stations, and Alaska village clinics. IHS's estimated budget authority for fiscal year 2018 is over $5.6 billion, an increase of almost $580 million from its enacted budget authority of just over $5 billion in fiscal year 2017. IHS has agreements with tribes and tribal organizations by which it transfers a substantial portion of its budget authority to tribes and tribal organizations. For example, in 2017, the agency transferred approximately 54 percent of its total budget authority to tribes and tribal organizations to operate part or all of their own health care programs through self-determination contracts and self-governance compacts.

Senate Report 114-49 also directed DOD to report on the flexible employment authorities available to DOD civilian employees. GAO was asked to review DOD's cost comparisons. This report examines DOD's cost comparisons and assesses the extent to which DOD addressed the mandated reporting element. GAO analyzed DOD's Cost-Comparison Report and interviewed DOD officials. What GAO Found The Department of Defense's (DOD) Cost-Comparison Report addressed three elements and partially addressed one element concerning the accounting for the fully-burdened, or full, cost of federal civilian and service contractor personnel performing functions at the selected installations. DOD's Cost-Comparison Report addressed three elements and partially addressed one element concerning the accounting for the fully-burdened, or full, cost of federal civilian and service contractor personnel performing functions at the selected installations. DOD developed a methodology to assess performance of functions performed by federal civilians and service contractors at organizations within nine geographic regions including two locations outside the continental United States. DOD identified federal civilians and service contractors performing similar functions as there is no direct mapping or perfect match between existing taxonomies used to quantify federal civilian positions and contracted services. DOD also reported that the day-to-day functions performed by federal civilian employees do not always directly correlate to the designated occupational series or the job title for their position. DOD identified in its Cost-Comparison Report that personnel need to perform at least 80 percent common tasks to be able to make a comparison.

    "gao_GAO-18-196": "Why GAO Did This Study In fiscal year 2017, Congress provided about $25 million to states to improve their child protective services systems. CAPTA requires states to have policies and procedures to address the needs of infants affected by prenatal substance abuse or displaying withdrawal symptoms at birth. GAO was asked to review CAPTA. This report examines (1) the extent to which states have policies and procedures to address the needs of infants affected by prenatal substance abuse and (2) the extent to which HHS has provided technical assistance and guidance to states to help them implement CAPTA. GAO surveyed all 50 states and the District of Columbia on their policies and procedures and visited three states selected based on the number of infants affected by substance abuse and the number of infants for whom a referral was made. GAO also interviewed HHS officials and reviewed relevant federal laws and regulations. What GAO Found In response to GAO's survey, 42 states reported that state policies and procedures require health care providers to notify the Department of Health and Human Services' (HHS) Child Protective Services (CPS) about substance-affected infants. Some states reported that they explicitly require health care providers to notify CPS of substance-affected infants. Others reported that the requirement is met by their states' mandated reporter law\u2014whereby people in certain positions, including health care providers, are required to report other instances of child abuse and neglect. In written responses to GAO's survey, some states reported providing training and guidance to support the efforts of health care providers to notify CPS about substance-affected infants. Despite these policies, procedures, and guidance, in written responses to GAO's survey, a few states reported concerns about requiring health care providers to notify CPS about substance-affected infants and the definition of substance-affected. All of the hospitals that GAO visited have policies consistent with their state's law that require that health care providers, primarily hospital social workers, to notify CPS about substance-affected infants. However, one state reported that some medical personnel have been reluctant to report some infants that are positive for illegal and legal substances due to fears of mothers being arrested. Another state reported that stakeholders are concerned that having to notify CPS about substance-affected infants will have a chilling effect on the willingness of pregnant women who use substances to be honest with providers and seek the help and support they need and",

FEMA's grant programs are intended to enhance the capacity of states, localities, and other entities, such as ports or transit agencies, to prevent, respond to, and recover from acts of terrorism and other catastrophic events. This statement discusses FEMA's progress in (1) addressing coordination, oversight, and assessment challenges between its headquarters and regional offices, and (2) assessing preparedness capabilities. This statement is based on GAO products issued from February 2012 through February 2018, selected updates conducted in February 2018, and selected updates conducted in April 2018. For selected updates, GAO reviewed relevant documents and interviewed FEMA officials. What GAO Found The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) has taken some steps to address coordination, oversight, and assessment challenges between its headquarters and regional offices, but challenges remain in the effectiveness of FEMA's grant management. For several preparedness grant programs, FEMA headquarters staff in its Grant Programs Directorate (GPD) and regional staff share management and monitoring responsibilities. For example, GPD and others since 2009 had recommended that regional offices, rather than headquarters offices, be responsible for managing and monitoring preparedness grants to avoid confusion and duplication, and to strengthen coordination with state and local grantees. However, GPD officials reported that in 2012 they changed course and decided to continue sharing grant management roles between headquarters and regional staff, referred to as a hybrid grant management structure. GPD officials told GAO that they changed course because, among other things, estimates that the costs of regionalization would be greater than the annual savings FEMA identified in an earlier study and concerns that inconsistent program implementation would occur across the regions, and outweighed the potential benefits. FEMA officials at that time said they had taken steps to address coordination challenges associated with this hybrid grant management structure. However, GAO found in February 2016 that these challenges continue. For example, FEMA regional officials reported that GPD staff in headquarters and regions did not always coordinate their monitoring visits, which can be disruptive to the state emergency management agency's day-to-day operations. FEMA officials also reported that GPD staff in headquarters and regions sometimes provided inconsistent guidance to grantees.

    "gao_GAO-18-377": "Why GAO Did This Study Improper payments are a long-standing, significant problem in the federal government. Estimation of improper payments is key to understanding the extent of the problem and to developing effective corrective actions to address it. GAO was asked to review improper payment estimation processes. This report examines (1) the characteristics of selected programs and (2) the extent to which selected agencies have developed improper payment estimates. GAO reviewed laws, OMB guidance, and policies and procedures for 10 programs and 6 agencies that were selected based on their size and complexity and the number of improper payments identified. GAO also reviewed improper payment estimates for fiscal year 2017 by six agencies and 10 programs. GAO also interviewed officials from OMB, DOD, and IRS. What GAO Found The 10 programs GAO reviewed varied in their processes to estimate improper payments, and some differences may hinder the usefulness of the resulting estimates. For example, the six agencies GAO reviewed used either statistically valid or alternative sampling approaches for the 10 programs, and some agencies reported additionally incorporating actual improper payment amounts into their estimates. For example, the Department of Defense (DOD) used a statistical approach to estimate its Military Pay improper payment estimate by adding debts due to DOD by a recipient of an overpayment identified during the fiscal year to a projected estimate of improper payments. The Office of Personnel Management (OPM) used a risk-based approach to estimate its Retirement program improper payment estimate by adding debts due to OPM by a recipient of an overpayment identified during the fiscal year to a projected estimate of underpayments. The six agencies GAO reviewed generally tested the data and calculated their improper payment estimates. Testing processes varied among the 10 programs, with some of the six agencies using processes designed specifically to estimate improper payments and others leveraging existing processes designed for other purposes. For example, DOD's Military Pay improper payment estimate comprises three component estimates for loan originations, consolidations, and refunds and the Medicaid estimate includes fee-for-service, managed care, and eligibility components. DOD's processes for estimating Military Pay improper payments may not reflect significant risks of improper payment in the program, specifically whether servicemembers are eligible for the special pay or allowances they receive, calling into question the improper payment estimate and its usefulness for developing effective corrective actions.

The National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2017 included a provision for GAO to review DHA's reporting of adverse medical events. This report examines (1) the extent to which DOD's policies for reporting adverse medical events align with DOD's policies, and (2) the extent to which DHA has complete information on sentinel events and root cause analysis (RCA) reports. GAO reviewed DOD policies and guidance, and interviewed officials from DHA, the military services, and the National Guard and Reserve (NCR). What GAO Found The military services' and NCR's policies for reporting adverse medical events do not consistently align with DOD's policies, but transition to DHA's policies is planned. For example, DOD's definition of an adverse medical event includes events that may or may not result in harm to the patient. However, the Army, Air Force, and Navy defined this term more narrowly, to include only an event that causes actual harm to the patient. While the difference in these definitions could potentially result in the underreporting of events, officials from all four of the MTFs GAO visited told us that the discrepancy does not have much of an impact because the individuals who report these events\u2014MTF personnel\u2014are unlikely to be aware of the difference and likely follow the broader DOD definition. The process used by the military services, NCR, and DHA to track sentinel events is fragmented. DHA requires that sentinel events be recorded in the JPSR system, but DHA officials told GAO that there are additional follow-up reports and associated deadlines for sentinel events that go beyond the JPSR system's current tracking capabilities, and as a result, officials from each of the military services and NCR told GAO they track sentinel events in their own tracking record outside of the JPSR system. DHA officials told GAO they must rely on their reconciliation process to ensure they have complete information on sentinel events and RCA reports. DHA officials told GAO they have no authority to compel a response from these entities, although this may change with the transition",

OCI was established in 2012 to conduct sexual assault investigations and state assessments of National Guard members. OCI is funded through appropriations made available for DOD's Sexual Assault Special Victims' Counsel Program. GAO was asked to review OCI's operations. This report examines (1) OCI's operations and funding, (2) OCI's policies and controls to help ensure key policies are followed, and (3) OCI's case files to determine how case acceptance criteria have been met. GAO reviewed relevant laws, guidance, and OCI policies and procedures and interviewed OCI officials. GAO also reviewed a non-generalizable sample of 27 case files from 5 states from fiscal years 2016 and 2017\u2014out of a total of approximately 225 cases for those same years\u2014and interviewed OCI officials. What GAO Found The National Guard Bureau's (NGB) Office of Complex Investigations (OCI) conducts administrative investigations of sexual assault, in addition to state assessments of state National Guard units. OCI is funded through appropriations made available for DOD's Sexual Assault Special Victims' Counsel Program. OCI is primarily funded through amounts made available for DOD's Sexual Assault Special Victims' Counsel Program. OCI is staffed with temporarily assigned National Guard members as investigators. OCI primarily relies on National Guard members staffed temporarily to the office as investigators to conduct its sexual assault investigations and state assessments. The National Guard reported to Congress in 2018 that OCI has experienced a 350 percent increase in requests for assistance from fiscal year 2014 to fiscal year 2017; and 53 of the 54 states and territories have requested OCI support during this period. OCI is funded through appropriations made available for DOD's Sexual Assault Special Victims' Counsel Program. Moreover, OCI is staffed with temporarily assigned National Guard members as investigators. OCI has policies for sexual assault investigations and controls to help ensure key policies are followed, but OCI has inconsistently documented how case acceptance criteria have been met.

    "gao_GAO-18-281": "Why GAO Did This Study VA has a consolidated community care program that provides care to veterans when services are unavailable at a VHA medical facility. The Choice Program allows veterans to choose to obtain care from TPAs rather than from VA medical facilities. GAO was asked to review the Choice Program. This report examines (1) the extent to which VA's Choice Program appointment scheduling process exceeded the Choice Act's 30-day wait-time requirement and (2) the extent to which VA's monitoring of veterans' access to care is consistent with federal internal control standards. GAO analyzed VA's Choice Program data from fiscal years 2015 through 2016 and interviewed VA and VHA officials. What GAO Found GAO's analysis of the Veterans Health Administration's (VHA) Choice Program appointment scheduling process indicates that veterans who are time-eligible could potentially wait up to 70 calendar days to obtain care, if VA medical centers (VAMC) and TPAs take the maximum amount of time allowed by VA's process. GAO's analysis indicates that veterans who are referred to the Choice Program for routine care because they are time-eligible could potentially wait up to 70 calendar days to obtain care, if VAMCs and TPAs take the maximum amount of time allowed by VA's process. The process VA and VHA designed did not include a limit on the number of days VAMCs have to complete a key step of the process\u2014compiling relevant clinical information and sending veterans' referrals to the TPAs after veterans have agreed to be referred to the program. Without specifying wait-time goals that are achievable, and without designing appointment scheduling processes that are consistent with those goals, VA lacks assurance that veterans are receiving care from community providers in a timely manner. It also lacks a means for comparing the timeliness of veterans' community care with that of care delivered within VHA medical facilities. GAO's analysis indicates that VHA's ability to monitor veterans' access to Choice Program care is limited because the data VHA uses are not always accurate and reliable, and VHA lacks certain data that are needed to effectively monitor the program. According to federal internal control standards for information and communication and for monitoring, agencies should use quality information to achieve the entity's objectives, internally and externally communicate quality information, and establish activities to monitor the quality of performance over time and evaluate the results.

    "gao_GAO-19-95": "Why GAO Did This Study In fiscal year 2017, the federal government provided about 42 million individuals with food assistance through SNAP. SNAP is the main federal benefit program for low-income households. GAO was asked to review food insecurity among college students. This report examines (1) what is known about the extent of food insecurity among college students and their use of SNAP; (2) how selected colleges are addressing student food insecurity; and (3) the extent to which federal programs assist college students experiencing food insecurity. GAO reviewed academic studies based on original research to determine what is known about food insecurity among college students. GAO also interviewed officials from federal agencies, researchers, and policy organizations. GAO also conducted four state site visits to selected colleges based on whether colleges and state government agencies were taking steps to address food insecurity among students, and geographic diversity, among other criteria. What GAO Found GAO's review of 31 academic studies based on original research found that food insecurity among college students is limited and many potentially eligible, at-risk students do not receive SNAP studies. The 31 studies GAO reviewed ranged from 9 percent to well over 50 percent, with 22 of these studies estimating food insecurity rates of over 30 percent. These results reflect the studies' different samples and methods, and the estimates from the studies included in GAO's review are not generalizable to the college student population as a whole. None of the studies are based on a sufficiently large or diverse random sample of college students to constitute a representative study. The studies addressed the difficulty of sampling the college student population in different ways, including by extrapolating from household data, surveying students in a particular degree program or on a particular campus, or targeting particular, non-random sub-groups of the college student population. Most of the studies were also conducted on only one campus, although some studies gathered data from more than one campus. Despite the limitations, these studies as a whole help shed some light on the range of food insecurity that exists among some groups of college students. For example, one study found that 15 percent of student respondents at one 4-year college experienced food insecurity, with an additional 16 percent at that college estimated to be at-risk for food insecurity. The prevalence of risk factors associated with food insecurity among low-income students was lower at 4-year colleges compared to other colleges. For",

NCA's plan to increase veterans' access to burial options includes building 18 new national cemeteries and awarding funds for new state veterans' cemeteries. GAO was asked to review NCA's plan. This report examines (1) NCA's plan to increase burial access for veterans and (2) challenges NCA faces in implementing its plan. GAO reviewed NCA's plan and interviewed NCA officials. GAO also reviewed VA's cost-estimating guidance and interviewed VA officials. What GAO Found The National Cemetery Administration (NCA) plans to increase burial access for veterans by building 18 new national cemeteries and awarding funds for new state veterans' cemeteries. In 2014, NCA estimated that 90 percent of the veteran population had reasonable access to burial options, and that it expected to reach its strategic goal of providing reasonable access to 96 percent of veterans by the end of fiscal year 2017. Since 2014, NCA has revised its strategic goal to provide reasonable access to 95 percent of the veteran population, and NCA's current long-range plan to achieve this goal covers fiscal years 2018- 2022. NCA has made some progress in implementing its plan to increase burial access for veterans, but that progress has been limited, as it is years behind its original schedule for opening new cemeteries. In 2014, NCA planned to open 18 new sites by the end of fiscal year 2017 to better serve the burial needs of the veteran population. As of September 2019, NCA has opened four new traditional national cemeteries\u2014Tallahassee National Cemetery in Tallahassee, Florida; Cape Canaveral National Cemetery in Mims, Florida; and Omaha National Cemetery in Omaha, Nebraska\u2014and two of its eight planned rural initiative cemeteries\u2014Yellowstone National Cemetery in Laurel, Montana, and Fargo National Cemetery in Harwood, North Dakota. As a result, according to NCA, by the end of fiscal year 2018 the percentage of veterans with reasonable access had increased from 90 percent to about 92 percent. NCA has experienced three key challenges in executing its plan to increase burial access for veterans: (1) acquiring suitable land for new national cemeteries; (2) estimating the costs associated with establishing new national cemeteries; and (3) using all available data to inform how",
    "gao_GAO-18-459": "Why GAO Did This Study The Animal Welfare Act requires federal agencies to report on their use of animals in research. The act also requires NIH to establish guidelines for federal research facilities that conduct activities using animals. GAO was asked to review federal agencies' use of animals. This report examines (1) the extent to which APHIS and NIH have instructed federal agencies to report their use of animals covered by the act and (2) the views of stakeholders on whether federal agencies should proactively and routinely share information about their animals on a website or other means. GAO reviewed the Animal Welfare Act and its regulations, surveyed federal agencies and other stakeholders, and interviewed officials from APHIS and NIH. What GAO Found The U.S. Department of Agriculture's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) and the National Institutes of Health (NIH) have instructed federal agencies to report their use of animals covered by the Animal Welfare Act from fiscal years 2014 through 2016. However, APHIS's instructions have not ensured consistent and complete reporting because they have been unclear about which animal species, activities, and activity locations are required to be reported for the purposes of the Animal Welfare Act. For example, APHIS's 2017 instructions for completing the annual report do not sufficiently clarify the conditions under which a field study would qualify, nor do they point to any source providing clarifying language. As a result, it is unclear when, or if, APHIS will require research facilities to report their use of birds covered by the act. In addition, GAO identified three areas in which federal agencies' annual reports were inconsistent or incomplete: birds, animal use outside the United States, and field studies. For example, GAO found that the Departments of Commerce and Defense and the Smithsonian Institution did not report animal use in their non-domestic facilities in fiscal years 2014 through 2016. As a result, the data that research facilities submit to APHIS in their annual reports may not accurately reflect the facilities' uses of animals covered by the act. GAO identified three areas in which federal agencies' annual reports were inconsistent or incomplete: birds, animal use outside the United States, and field studies.

HIE organizations match patient records as part of their role in facilitating the electronic exchange of health information among hospitals, physicians, and other organizations. GAO was asked to review patient record matching. This report examines (1) how HIE organizations and providers match patients' records and the challenges they face in doing so, and (2) the extent to which HIE organizations and providers have undertaken efforts to improve patient record matching. GAO reviewed relevant federal laws, regulations, and guidance; interviewed officials from HHS, the Office of the National Coordinator for Health Information Technology (ONC), and other stakeholders; and reviewed relevant federal laws, regulations, and guidance. What GAO Found Stakeholders GAO interviewed described patient record matching approaches and associated challenges, and identified efforts they have undertaken or are currently undertaking to improve the ability to match patients' medical records accurately. Providers and health information technology (IT) vendors described manual and automated approaches to patient record matching. Stakeholders also described inaccurate, incomplete, or inconsistently formatted demographic information in patients' medical records. Stakeholders identified several reasons that patients' demographic information can be incomplete or contain different data elements across the medical records maintained by multiple providers. For example, providers collect different information from their patients, and health IT systems can collect demographic data differently. Stakeholders identified some patient populations for which matching is particularly challenging, due in part to data issues. For example, three provider representatives said that medical records for newborns often contain temporary names that are not updated with the child's legal name after it is determined, which makes it difficult to locate these records. Stakeholders identified efforts they have undertaken or are currently undertaking to improve the ability to match patients' medical records accurately. For example, in 2017, 23 providers in Texas reached agreement on, and then implemented, standards for how staff should record patients' names, addresses, and other data in order to improve record matching and facilitate health information exchange. In 2017, 23 providers in Texas implemented agreed-upon standards for capturing patient name, address, and other data. Stakeholders identified several efforts that could improve patient record matching, and had varying views on the roles ONC and others should play in these efforts. Among the examples of efforts stakeholders identified that could improve matching were implementing common standards for demographic data; developing",

The 2016 NDAA required SBA to report to Congress by March 31, 2019, about changes to the scorecard methodology and recommend whether the scorecard program should continue or be further modified. GAO was asked to review SBA's scorecard program. This report examines (1) changes SBA made to the Small Business Procurement Scorecard methodology for fiscal year 2017 and results of the fiscal year 2017 scorecard, as well as the extent to which SBA plans to evaluate the effects of revisions; (2) the extent to which SBA's revised scorecard methodology uses relevant and reliable information and SBA publishes accurate scorecards; and (3) views of selected federal agencies and industry stakeholders on the extent to which SBA's revised scorecard methodology may encourage agencies to expand small business procurement opportunities. GAO reviewed relevant documents and interviewed officials from SBA and four federal departments and three small business groups selected based on small business procurement volume and recent improvement in scorecard results. What GAO Found The Small Business Administration (SBA) revised the Small Business Procurement Scorecard methodology for fiscal year 2017 to make it consistent with changes required by the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2016. Specifically, SBA reduced the proportion of the total scorecard results related to prime contracting performance from 80 percent to 50 percent and added an element to calculate changes in the number of small business prime contractors compared to the prior year. SBA officials said they considered, but did not add, a scorecard element that calculated changes in the number of small business subcontractors, which the 2016 NDAA required to be included if data were available. SBA officials said they determined that data were not available to implement this change. SBA also made other changes to the scorecard methodology, as the agency was permitted to do under the 2016 NDAA. SBA adjusted the weights of other scorecard elements, increasing subcontracting performance from 10 percent to 20 percent and increasing the peer review evaluation element from 10 percent to 20 percent. SBA officials said the council members gave input on proposed revisions and recommended changes prior to the adoption of the new scorecard methodology.

In 2016, VA began a transition to a new program, called MSPV-NG, to standardize medical supplies. This statement discusses the extent to which VA's implementation of MSPV-NG has achieved its goals. This statement is based on GAO's November 2017 report, Medical Supply Procurement-Next Generation: VA's Implementation of MSPV-NG Has Yet to Achieve Its Goals (GAO-17-28). GAO reviewed VA's MSPV-NG program documents and interviewed VA officials and selected hospital networks. What GAO Found The Veterans Health Administration's (VHA) implementation of its Medical Supply Procurement-Next Generation (MSPV-NG) program\u2014from its initial work to identify a list of supply requirements in early 2015, through its roll-out of the formulary to medical centers in December 2016\u2014was not executed in line with leading practices. Specifically, VHA lacked a documented program strategy, leadership stability, and workforce capacity for the transition that, if in place, could have facilitated buy-in for the change throughout the organization. Further, the initial requirements development process and tight time frames contributed to ineffective contracting processes. As a result, VHA developed an initial formulary that did not meet the needs of the medical centers and has yet to achieve utilization and cost avoidance goals. VA made some changes in the second phase of requirements development to address deficiencies identified in the initial roll out. Key among these was to increase the level of clinical involvement, that is, to obtain input from the doctors and nurses at VA's individual medical facilities. Despite changes aimed at improving implementation, the agency continues to face challenges that prevent the program from fully achieving its goals.

DHS has several programs and activities designed to prevent and protect against domestic chemical attacks. GAO was asked to review DHS's efforts to prevent and protect against chemical attacks. This report examines (1) DHS's programs and activities intended to prevent and protect against chemical attacks, and (2) DHS's efforts to integrate and coordinate its chemical defense programs and activities. GAO reviewed relevant laws and presidential directives, and interviewed DHS officials. What GAO Found The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) manages several programs and activities designed to prevent and protect against domestic chemical attacks. Prior to December 2017, three DHS components\u2014the Office of Health Affairs (OHA), Science and Technology Directorate (S&T), and National Protection and Programs Directorate (NPPD)\u2014had specific programs and activities focused on chemical defense. In December 2017, DHS created the Countering Weapons of Mass Destruction (CWMD) Office, which consolidated the majority of OHA and some other DHS programs and activities intended to counter weapons of mass destruction such as chemical weapons. Other DHS components\u2014such as Customs and Border Protection (CBP), the Coast Guard, and the Transportation Security Administration (TSA)\u2014have chemical defense programs and activities as part of their broader missions. These components address potential chemical attacks as part of an all-hazards approach to address a wide range of threats and hazards. DHS's chemical defense programs and activities have been fragmented and not well coordinated across the department. For example, OHA and S&T\u2014two components with specific chemical defense programs\u2014both conducted similar but separate projects to assist local jurisdictions with preparedness. Officials from OHA, S&T, and the CWMD Office acknowledged that chemical defense activities had been fragmented and not well coordinated. They stated that this fragmentation occurred because DHS had no department-wide leadership and direction for chemical defense activities.

This report examines (1) the extent to which reservists incur out-of-pocket travel expenses under certain conditions, and (2) DOD's assessment of the potential effect of unreimbursed out-of-pocket travel expenses on the retention of reservists. GAO reviewed DOD's travel regulations and other documents, and interviewed officials from DOD's six reserve components. What GAO Found Reservists may incur out-of-pocket travel expenses under certain conditions in connection with their service that are not reimbursable under Department of Defense (DOD) travel regulations. Officials responsible for travel regulations and reserve policy issues told GAO that this can occur because (1) the cost to attend Inactive Duty Training is a reservist's responsibility, except in limited circumstances; and (2) DOD designates longer duration training or assignments as a Permanent Change of Station\u2014a change in a reservist's home of record\u2014and not as temporary travel. DOD's Joint Travel Regulations govern the extent to which reservists are eligible to be reimbursed for travel expenses to participate in required training or in other duties. The regulations authorize the reimbursement of different types of expenses depending on the nature and duration of the assignment. Eligible reimbursements include: Per diem, which includes reimbursement for food, temporary lodging, Transportation expenses, ranging from reimbursement for mileage traveled in reservists' private vehicles to reimbursement for commercial flights; Permanent Change of Station reimbursements related to reservists changing their home of record to the location of the assignment, such as reimbursement for the movement of household goods; and Basic Allowance for Housing, which is based on the costs of adequate rental properties for civilians with comparable income levels in the same location as the permanent duty station, which in the case of reservists is generally the location of their home.

    "gao_GAO-19-179": "Why GAO Did This Study In 2013, individuals ages 25 to 55 withdrew at least $68.7 billion early from their retirement accounts. These withdrawals represent a small percentage of overall assets in these accounts, but can erode or even deplete an individual's retirement savings. GAO was asked to review early withdrawals of retirement savings. This report examines (1) what is known about the incidence and amount of early withdrawals from retirement savings; (2) what is known about the factors that might lead individuals to access their retirement savings early; and (3) what strategies or policies, if any, might reduce the incidence and amount of early withdrawals of retirement savings. GAO analyzed 2013 data from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and the Department of Labor (DOL) on early withdrawals from retirement plans and IRAs, and interviewed officials from DOL, IRS, and DOL. GAO also reviewed relevant literature and interviewed retirement research experts, financial technology companies, participant advocacy organizations, and industry associations. What GAO Found In 2013, individuals ages 25 to 55 withdrew at least $68.7 billion early from their retirement accounts. Of this amount, IRA owners in this age group withdrew the largest share (about 57 percent) and 401(k) plan participants in this age group withdrew the rest (about 43 percent) However, a total amount withdrawn from 401(k) plans cannot be determined due to data limitations. In 2013, an estimated $39.5 billion of the $68.7 billion in early withdrawals made by individuals ages 25 to 55 in 2013 exceeded their total contributions to retirement accounts. The incidence and amount of early withdrawals from retirement plans also contributed to reductions in overall savings. For example, in 2013, an estimated 1.1 percent (+/-0.11) of plan participants ages 25 to 55 withdrew an aggregate $9.8 billion from their plans that they did not roll into another qualified plan or individual retirement account (IRA). Additionally, 86 percent (+/-2.9) of these participants taking a cashout of $1,000 or more did not roll over the amount in 2013. The incidence and amount of unrepaid plan loans from 401(k) plans cannot be determined due to the way DOL collects data from plan sponsors. Additional information on loan offsets would provide insight into how plan loan features might affect long-term retirement savings. Without clear data on the incidence and amount",
    "gao_GAO-18-313": "Why GAO Did This Study Money transmitters are a key source of funds for GAO's case-study countries, including Haiti, Liberia, Nepal, and Somalia. The BSA requires money transmitters to establish and implement a written anti-money laundering program. GAO was asked to review money transmitters' access to funds. This report examines (1) what stakeholders believe are the challenges facing money transmitters in remitting funds from the United States to selected fragile countries, (2) what actions U.S. agencies have taken to address identified challenges, and (3) U.S. efforts to assess the effects of such challenges on remittance flows from the United States to fragile countries. GAO surveyed banks and interviewed U.S. agency officials, money transmitters, and remittance senders in four case-study countries\u2014Haiti, Liberia, Nepal, and Somalia\u2014based on their inclusion in the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development's States of Fragility reports from 2013 to 2015. GAO also interviewed U.S. agency officials and analyzed U.S. agency data on remittance flows through banking and non-banking channels. What GAO Found Money transmitters serving Haiti, Liberia, Nepal, and especially Somalia reported losing bank accounts or having restrictions placed on them, which some banks confirmed. As a result, some money transmitters have relied on non-banking channels, such as cash couriers, to transfer remittances. All of the 12 money transmitters GAO interviewed reported losing some banking relationships in the last 10 years. Some money transmitters, including all 4 that served Somalia, said they relied on non-banking channels, such as moving cash, to transfer funds, which increased their operational costs and exposure to risks. Further, in GAO's interviews some banks reported that they had closed the accounts of money transmitters because of the high cost of due diligence actions they considered necessary to minimize the risk of fines under Bank Secrecy Act anti-money laundering (BSA/AML) regulations. Treasury officials noted that despite information that some money transmitters have lost bank accounts, Treasury sees no evidence that the volume of remittances is falling or that costs of sending remittances are rising. In addition, U.S.-based re",
    "gao_GAO-18-608": "Why GAO Did This Study There are many nonimmigrant visas (NIV), which are issued to foreign nationals such as tourists, business visitors, and students seeking temporary admission into the United States. The Department of State (State) is generally responsible for the adjudication of NIV applications, and manages the application process, including the consular officer corps and its functions at more than 220 visa-issuing posts overseas. GAO was asked to review the NIV adjudication process. This report examines (1) the number of NIV applications adjudicated annually (or, NIV adjudications) and the number of NIV refusals, and (2) the extent to which the executive actions taken in calendar year 2017 resulted in NIV applications being refused. GAO analyzed State data from fiscal years 2012 through 2017, reviewed relevant executive actions, and interviewed officials from DHS, State, DOJ, and ODNI. What GAO Found The total number of NIV applications that consular officers adjudicated annually (or, NIV adjudications) peaked at about 13.4 million in fiscal year 2016, which was an increase of approximately 30 percent since fiscal year 2012. In fiscal year 2017, NIV adjudications decreased by about 880,000 adjudications, or about 7 percent. The percentage of NIV applicants refused\u2014known as the refusal rate\u2014increased from 14 percent in fiscal year 2012 to about 22 percent in fiscal year 2016, and remained about the same in fiscal year 2017 as the previous year. The NIV refusal rate varied by visa group. The highest refusal rate was for tourists and business visitors, which rose from about 15 percent in fiscal year 2012 to over 25 percent in fiscal year 2017. The majority of NIV applications refused from fiscal years 2012 through 2017 were due to consular officers finding the applicants ineligible, a relatively small number of refusals were due to terrorism and other security-related concerns. In calendar year 2017, the President issued two executive orders and a presidential proclamation that required, among other actions, visa entry restrictions for nationals of certain countries of concern, a review of information needed for visa adjudication, and changes to visa (including NIV) screening and vetting protocols and procedures. Initially, the President issued Executive Order 13769, Protecting the Nation from Foreign Terrorist Entry Into the United States, which imposed visa entry restrictions for",
    "gao_GAO-18-656": "Why GAO Did This Study The United States invests more than 25 federal agencies in research and development, and these agencies may play different roles in supporting research that may lead to potentially transformational technologies. GAO was asked to review federal support for research in the areas of quantum computing and synthetic biology. This report examines (1) the extent to which federal agencies and nonfederal entities support these two areas of research and (2) key considerations for maintaining U.S. competitiveness through transformational technological advances. GAO reviewed relevant federal laws, regulations, and guidance; analyzed agency documents; and interviewed agency officials, stakeholders, and experts. What GAO Found Multiple federal agencies and nonfederal entities support quantum computing and synthetic biology research that could lead to transformational technological advances in many areas of the U.S. economy, including energy, medicine, and national security. GAO identified 6 agencies that in fiscal year 2016 through the second quarter of fiscal year 2018 supported quantum computing research to advance foundational understanding of quantum computing or to develop related hardware and software. Similarly, GAO identified 10 agencies that, during the timeframe GAO reviewed, supported synthetic biology research to advance foundational understanding of synthetic biology or knowledge of how to apply it in bioengineering, national security, and biofuels development. GAO also identified a variety of nonfederal entities, such as universities and private companies, that conduct research in these areas. Agencies coordinate on quantum computing and synthetic biology research through a range of efforts, but GAO found that certain efforts are new and that agencies have not fully implemented selected leading practices for collaboration in these efforts. For example, the National Science and Technology Council (NSTC) established a new synthetic biology working group in June 2018, which is a key component of NSTC's efforts to coordinate research. However, the new group has not fully implemented the relevant leading practices for collaboration GAO has identified. For example, the group has not identified other member agencies' roles and responsibilities. As the new group moves forward, by taking steps to fully implement these leading practices, member agencies could better marshal their collective efforts to support research in the areas of quantum computing and synthetic biology and help maintain U.S. competitiveness through transformational technological advances. Experts identified four key considerations for maintaining U.S. competitiveness through transformational technological advances. These considerations extend beyond quantum computing and synthetic biology, and more broadly address the role of federal and nonfederal entities in",
    "gao_GAO-18-502": "Why GAO Did This Study In 2014, WIOA amended the Rehabilitation Act to require state VR agencies to provide students with disabilities with pre-employment transition services. In response to a mandate in the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act of 2017 (WIOA), GAO was asked to review state VR agencies' implementation of WIOA. This report examines (1) the steps states have reported taking to implement pre-employment transition services, and (2) the implementation challenges, if any, states reported facing, and how the Department of Education (Education) has addressed them. GAO surveyed all 79 state VR agencies from October through December 2017 and interviewed officials from Education, the National Technical Assistance Center on Transition, and the Council of State Administrators of Vocational Rehabilitation (CSAVR). GAO also convened three discussion groups with state VR agency directors or their designated officials. GAO also reviewed federal laws and regulations, and Education's guidance and technical assistance documents. What GAO Found Most state VR agencies that responded to GAO's survey reported expanding services for students with disabilities since WIOA's enactment in July 2014 by either serving more students through pre-employment transition services or by initiating new or additional services. Most state VR agencies that responded to GAO's survey reported that they had previously provided and continue to provide transition services to students who apply and are eligible for the VR program, and many of the activities were not entirely new to state VR agencies. Most VR agencies reported providing each of the required activities to students with disabilities before WIOA's enactment, while fewer reported initiating these services since enactment. Most VR agencies reported expanding services for students with disabilities by either serving more students through pre-employment transition services or by initiating new or additional services. Most VR agencies reported building staff capacity to facilitate and carry out the requirements of pre-employment transition services by, for example, establishing a new specialist position and expanding contracts with service providers. Twenty-one of 56 states (50 states, 5 territories, and the District of Columbia) reported using the full amount of grant funds they reserved for pre-employment transition services for students with disabilities for fiscal year 2016, according to the most recent full year of data available from Education. Thirty-two of the 74 agencies reported using the minimum required 15 percent of federal VR grant funds reserved for the provision of pre-employment transition services for fiscal years 2016 and 2017.

    "gao_GAO-19-15": "Why GAO Did This Study VBA is responsible for processing disability compensation claims for veterans with service-connected disabilities. VBA has established national targets and tracks performance for disability compensation claims processing. GAO was asked to review VBA's disability compensation claims processing. This report examines (1) how VBA manages claims workload and performance across regional offices, and (2) the extent to which VBA's performance measures reflect regional office performance. GAO reviewed VBA data on claims processing timeliness and accuracy, and interviewed VBA officials and representatives from VSOs and congressional caseworkers. GAO also visited four regional offices selected based on geographic diversity and other factors. What GAO Found The Veterans Benefits Administration (VBA) manages claims workload and performance through established processes, but guidance for processing claims with errors has gaps. VBA uses the National Work Queue to distribute disability compensation claims across regional offices, but guidance for processing claims with errors has gaps. For example, in fiscal year 2017, about 88 percent of all disability compensation claims were processed by more than one office, and over 75 percent were processed by three or more offices. VBA officials stated that they had initially planned to continue to have a majority of claims processed at veterans' local regional offices, but after implementation of the National Work Queue they determined that the system operates more effectively if veteran location is a lower priority factor for claims distribution. In addition, VBA has developed processes and tools for communicating performance information to regional offices and for identifying common errors. For example, VBA sets regional office goals and individual claims processor expectations that align with national efforts to increase timeliness and accuracy of claims decisions. However, VBA's performance measures do not adequately reflect regional office performance for disability compensation claims processing. For example, VBA uses the average number of business days that claims have been pending at a regional office to measure overall regional office performance, but this measure does not capture performance over a period of time. Consequently, the measure does not capture regional office performance over a period of time. Until VBA implements a new measure to more fully assess regional office performance, the agency will not have a complete picture of regional office performance over time, which could impair decision-making related to regional office performance, such as targeting resources to high- or low-performing offices. Stakeholders were generally satisfied with VBA's communication with selected regional offices, but VBA'",
    "gao_GAO-18-596T": "Why GAO Did This Study Burn pits\u2014shallow excavations or surface features with berms used to conduct open-air burning\u2014were often chosen as a method of waste disposal during recent contingency operations in the CENTCOM area of responsibility, which extends from the Middle East to Central Asia and includes Iraq and Afghanistan. In 2010, GAO reported that there were 251 active burn pits in Afghanistan and 22 in Iraq. However, in 2016, GAO reported that the use of burn pits in the CENTCOM area of responsibility had declined since that time. As of June 2016, DOD officials told GAO that there were no military-operated burn pits in Afghanistan and only one in Iraq. According to DOD officials, the decline in the number of burn pits from 2010 to 2016 could be attributed to such factors as (1) using contractors for waste disposal and (2) increased use of waste management alternatives such as landfills and incinerators. However, DOD officials acknowledged that burn pits were being used to dispose of waste in other locations that are not military-operated. Specifically, these officials noted instances in which local contractors had been contracted to haul away waste and subsequently disposed of the waste in a burn pit located in close proximity to the installation. In such instances, officials stated that they requested that the contractors relocate the burn pit. In September 2016, GAO reported that the effects from exposing individuals to burn pit emissions were not well understood, and DOD had not fully assessed these health risks. In its 2016 report, GAO found that the effects from exposing individuals to burn pit emissions were not well understood, and DOD had not fully assessed these health risks. Notwithstanding this guidance, which applies to burn pit emissions among other health hazards, DOD had not fully assessed these health risks according to DOD officials. According to DOD officials, DOD's ability to assess these risks was limited by a lack of adequate information on (1) the levels of exposure to burn pit emissions and (2) the health impacts these exposures had on individuals. With respect to information on exposure levels, DOD had not collected data from emissions or monitored exposures from burn pits as required by its own guidance. DOD Instruction 4715.19 requires that plans for the use of open-air burn pits include ensuring the area was monitored by qualified force health protection personnel for unacceptable exposures, and CENTCOM Regulation 200-2, CENTCOM",
    "gao_GAO-18-694T": "Why GAO Did This Study In fiscal year 2018, Medicare and Medicaid spent about $1.3 billion on nursing homes, which are a critical component of the nation's health care system. GAO has previously reported on the quality of nursing home care and the extent to which CMS oversees nursing homes. This statement discusses (1) the results of GAO's October 2015 report on nursing home quality, (2) CMS's oversight of nursing home quality, and (3) CMS's actions to improve nursing home quality. This statement is based on GAO's October 2015 report, Nursing Home Quality: CMS Should Continue to Improve Data and Oversight (GAO-16-33), which examined CMS's nursing home quality data and oversight activities. GAO reviewed relevant laws, regulations, and CMS documents and interviewed CMS officials. What GAO Found In its October 2015 report, GAO found that four key data sets showed mixed results, and data issues complicated the ability to assess quality trends. Nationally, one of the four data sets\u2014consumer complaints\u2014suggested consumers' concerns over nursing home quality increased from 2005 to 2014. However, the other three data sets\u2014deficiencies, staffing levels, and clinical quality measures\u2014indicated potential improvement in nursing home quality. Specifically, GAO found consumer complaints\u2014which can originate from residents, families, ombudsmen, or others acting on a resident's behalf\u2014had a 21 percent increase from 2005 to 2014. In contrast, nurse staffing levels increased 9 percent from 2009 to 2014 and selected quality measure scores showed decreases in the number of reported quality problems, such as falls resulting in major injury from 2011 to 2014. In addition, GAO identified 416 homes in 36 states that had consistently poor performance across the four data sets GAO examined. In its October 2015 report, GAO found CMS's ability to use available data to assess nursing home quality trends was complicated by various issues with these data, which made it difficult to determine whether observed trends reflect actual changes in quality, data issues, or both. CMS has taken some actions to address these data complications, however, more work is needed. Consumer complaints: The average number of consumer complaints reported per nursing home increased in the 10 years of data GAO examined, although it is unclear to what extent this can be attributed to a change in quality or to state variation in the recording of complaints.

    "gao_GAO-19-120T": "Why GAO Did This Study DOD reported that more than a decade of conflict, budget uncertainty, and reductions in force structure have degraded military readiness; in response, the department has made rebuilding the readiness of the military forces a priority. The 2018 National Defense Strategy emphasizes that restoring and retaining readiness across the entire spectrum of conflict is critical to success in the emerging security environment. Nevertheless, DOD reported readiness of the total military force remains low and has remained so since 2013. GAO's work has shown that Air Force readiness, in particular, has steadily declined due to a persistent demand for forces, a decline in equipment availability and experienced maintenance personnel, the effect of high deployment rates on units' ability to conduct needed training, and a smaller inventory of aircraft. DOD has made department-wide progress in developing a plan to rebuild readiness of the military force. In August 2018, GAO reported that the Office of the Secretary of Defense has developed a Readiness Recovery Framework that the Department is using to guide the military services' efforts and plans to regularly assess, validate, and monitor readiness recovery. However, additional work remains to ensure that the actions DOD is taking will ultimately achieve overall readiness goals. This testimony discusses (1) the challenges the Air Force faces in rebuilding its existing force and (2) the extent to which the Air Force will be able to balance near-term readiness recovery with plans to grow and modernize the force. This statement is based on prior GAO reports issued from September 2016 through September 2018. GAO's work has shown that Air Force readiness, in particular, has steadily declined due to a persistent demand for forces, a decline in equipment availability and experienced maintenance personnel, the effect of high deployment rates on units' ability to conduct needed training, and a smaller inventory of aircraft. DOD has made department-wide progress in developing a plan to rebuild readiness of the military force. In August 2018, GAO reported that the Office of the Secretary of Defense and the military services are currently revising readiness goals and accompanying recovery strategies, metrics, and milestones to align with the 2018 National Defense Strategy and Defense Planning Guidance. However, additional work remains to ensure that the actions DOD is taking will ultimately achieve overall readiness goals. DOD's readiness rebuilding efforts are occurring in a challenging context that requires the department to make difficult decisions regarding how best to address continuing operational demands while preparing for future challenges.",
    "gao_GAO-18-197T": "Why GAO Did This Study The Select Agent Program is a federal program that oversees high-containment laboratories that handle potentially hazardous pathogens. The program is administered by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the American Public Health Institute (APHIS), two agencies that oversee high-containment laboratories. The program is responsible for ensuring that the laboratories it oversees are safe and secure. This statement discusses (1) the extent to which the program meets key elements of effective oversight and (2) how selected countries and regulatory sectors promote effective oversight. This statement is based on GAO's October 2017 report, Select Agent Program: Oversight Needed to Better Manage Fragmentation and Work with CDC and APHIS (GAO-17-282). GAO reviewed program documents and interviewed program officials and representatives from CDC and APHIS. What GAO Found The Select Agent Program does not fully meet key elements of effective oversight. In particular, the program has oversight shortcomings related to each of GAO's five key elements: independence, performing reviews, technical expertise, transparency, and enforcement. In addition, the program does not have joint strategic planning documents to guide its oversight efforts, such as a joint strategic plan and workforce plan. It did, however, begin taking steps to develop a joint strategic plan during the summer of 2017. First, regarding independence, the Select Agent Program is not structurally distinct and separate from all of the laboratories it oversees because the two components of the Select Agent Program are located in CDC and APHIS, both of which also have high-containment laboratories registered with the program. Many experts at GAO's meeting raised concerns that the Select Agent Program cannot be entirely independent in its oversight of CDC and APHIS laboratories because the Select Agent Program is composed of divisions of those agencies. To help reduce conflicts of interest, the program has taken steps such as having APHIS lead inspections of CDC laboratories. However, it has generally done so in response to concerns raised by others. Second, regarding the ability to perform reviews, GAO found that the Select Agent Program performs several types of reviews to ensure compliance with regulatory and program requirements. However, the program may not target the highest-risk activities in its inspections, in part because it has not formally assessed which activities pose the highest risk to biological safety and security. For example, many experts at GAO",

In fiscal year 2017, the Departments of State (State), Labor (DOL), and USAID awarded about $62 million to implementing partners to carry out counter-trafficking projects. GAO was asked to review the effectiveness of these agencies' programs in limiting human trafficking and modern slavery. This report (1) identifies the recent projects in international counter-trafficking in persons that key U.S. agencies have awarded to implementing partners, and for selected projects, assesses the extent to which key agencies have (2) documented their monitoring activities, (3) ensured the reliability of the performance information they use in monitoring projects, and (4) reviewed the usefulness of the performance indicators they use in monitoring projects. GAO reviewed agency policies and procedures, and interviewed agency officials. GAO also reviewed a nongeneralizable sample of five projects\u2014two State projects, one DOL project, and two USAID projects\u2014that were active in fiscal year 2017. What GAO Found The Departments of State (State), DOL, and USAID\u2014which are responsible for international counter-trafficking in persons efforts\u2014use a number of similar tools to monitor the performance of their counter-trafficking in persons projects, including monitoring plans, indicators and targets, periodic progress reports, and final progress reports. However, State did not fully document its monitoring activities for 16 of 37 (43 percent) of the projects GAO reviewed with project start dates between fiscal years 2011 and 2016. For example, State did not have nine monitoring plans, five complete progress reports, or targets for each indicator in six of seven final progress reports for projects that ended as of December 2017. Without timely documentation of the monitoring plans at the start of the project, State may not be able to ensure that projects are achieving their goals, as intended, from the beginning of project operations. For the six projects for which targets were not fully documented in the final progress reports, GAO found that targets were lacking for 110 of 253 (43 percent) of indicators across the six final progress reports. Without controls to ensure full documentation of monitoring activities and established targets, State is limited in its ability to assess project performance, including project efficiency or effectiveness. For selected indicators in two State projects and two USAID projects,",
    "gao_GAO-18-678": "Why GAO Did This Study DOD spends at least $20 billion annually to sustain 12 fixed-wing aircraft, which need expensive logistics support, including maintenance and repair, to meet aircraft availability goals. GAO was asked to review the Air Force and Navy's efforts to sustain these aircraft. This report examines (1) trends in aircraft availability and operating and support (O&S) costs for selected Air Force and Navy fixed-wing aircraft, including whether the aircraft met availability goals, and (2) the extent to which the Air Force and Navy have sustainment strategies, regularly review sustainment metrics, and have plans to improve aircraft availability. GAO selected a nongeneralizable sample of 12 fixed-wing aircraft, based on age, size of inventory, and whether the aircraft were sustained organically by DOD or through contract arrangements, such as public-private partnerships or performance-based logistics. GAO also reviewed DOD, Air Force, and Navy guidance and policies and procedures. GAO also interviewed officials from the Air Force and Navy, and reviewed sustainment strategies, performance management frameworks, and improvement plans for each of the 12 aircraft. What GAO Found For the selected Air Force and Navy fixed-wing aircraft in GAO's review, aircraft availability and O&S cost trends varied over the 6-year period between fiscal years 2011 and 2016, and the aircraft generally did not meet availability goals. For example, 6 of 12 fixed-wing aircraft\u20143 from each service\u2014experienced decreased aircraft availability between fiscal years 2011 and 2016. Conversely, six aircraft met the goals in some years but not others, and five aircraft did not meet the goals in any year. With respect to O&S costs, the overall O&S total for all 12 aircraft was about $20 billion annually over the 6-year period; some aircraft experienced increases while the costs to operate and support others decreased. The reasons for changes in costs included increases in maintenance costs for 8 of 12 fixed-wing aircraft. The Air Force and Navy face similar sustainment challenges that relate to aging, maintenance, and supply support that affect aircraft availability and O&S costs for the 12 aircraft selected in GAO's review. Specifically, 10 of 12 aircraft are experiencing sustainment challenges related to aging; all 12 are experiencing challenges related to maintenance; and all 12 are also experiencing challenges related to supply support. The Air Force and Navy have (1) regularly reviewed sustainment metrics for fixed-wing aircraft and (2) implemented improvement plans to address aircraft availability. The Air",
    "gao_GAO-18-33": "Why GAO Did This Study DOD has a history of addressing unwanted sexual behaviors, including sexual assault, sexual harassment, and domestic violence. The National Defense Authorization Act for FY 2013 included a provision for GAO to review DOD's efforts to address unwanted sexual behaviors. This report examines the extent to which DOD has policies on sexual harassment that include CDC principles and relevant legislative elements and the extent to which DOD has processes for maintaining and reporting consistent data on incidents of unwanted sexual behaviors. GAO compared DOD's policies with CDC's framework for preventing sexual violence and reviewed DOD reports to Congress that provide incident data on unwanted sexual behaviors. GAO also interviewed officials from OSD and service-level sexual harassment offices. What GAO Found The Department of Defense's (DOD) policies on sexual harassment include some but not all of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC) principles and most relevant legislative elements. DOD's policies generally include prevention strategies that CDC has identified in its principles for sexual violence prevention but leave out risk and protective factors, as well as risk domains. Additionally, DOD's sexual harassment policies include most elements identified in section 579 of the National Defense Authorization Act for FY 2013, but do not consistently include mechanisms for anonymous reporting. DOD officials stated that they plan to issue a new policy that is intended to focus on sexual harassment and other forms of harassment, but it is too early to know whether that policy will include all the CDC principles or mechanisms for anonymous reporting. DOD has processes for maintaining and reporting consistent data on sexual assault incidents and domestic violence incidents that involve sexual assault, but the department does not have similar assurance of consistent data on incidents of sexual harassment. The military services maintain sexual harassment incident data in military service-specific databases, and there is no centralized database similar to the Defense Sexual Assault Incident Database or the Central Registry. DOD has several overarching efforts to address unwanted sexual behaviors across the continuum of harm, including a new office to oversee the integration and coordination of unwanted sexual behaviors in 2015 and is in the process of developing an overarching prevention strategy. However, because the strategy is under development, it is unclear whether it will contain key elements for long-term and results-oriented strategic planning. DOD also has ongoing collaborative efforts to address unwanted sexual behaviors along the continuum of harm. Specifically, DOD established an office to oversee",

BSA/AML regulations promote the integrity of the financial system by helping federal and state agencies detect money laundering, drug trafficking, and other financial crimes. GAO was asked to review the Southwest border region's financial system. This report examines (1) the extent to which Southwest border banks have reported affecting their compliance with BSA/AML requirements and (2) the extent to which banks have evaluated the BSA/AML regulatory concerns influencing their decision to terminate and limit accounts and close branches. GAO analyzed bank data and documents, surveyed banks, and held discussion groups with bank representatives in Arizona, California, and Texas. GAO also interviewed federal banking regulators and law enforcement officials. What GAO Found The Southwest border region faces high money laundering and related financial crime risks due to its proximity to Mexico and its high volume of cash transactions. Banks in the Southwest border region reported that they have increased their efforts to comply with Bank Secrecy Act (BSA)/AML requirements, such as requiring banks to report suspicious activity. However, GAO's nationally representative survey of Southwest border banks found that most banks terminated accounts for reasons related to BSA/AML risk. For example, 93 percent of Southwest border banks terminated accounts because of the filing of suspicious activity reports (SAR) associated with the accounts. However, GAO's econometric analysis also found that many Southwest border banks may also be engaging in derisking. For example, GAO's econometric analysis suggests that counties that were urban, younger, had higher income, or had higher money laundering-related risk were more likely to lose branches. Money laundering-related risk factors were likely to have been relatively more important in the Southwest border region because it had much higher SAR filings and a larger share of counties designated as High Intensity Financial Crime Areas (HIFCA) or High Intensity Drug Trafficking Areas (HIDTA).

    "gao_GAO-18-558": "Why GAO Did This Study DOD has privatized utility systems on its installations to address its energy needs. DOD has not privatized utility systems for security reasons, such as installations with highly sensitive missions, or when privatization is uneconomical. DOD has issued guidance for utilities privatization, but it has not developed measurable performance standards for these contracts. GAO was asked to review DOD's utilities privatization contracts. This report examines (1) the information DOD has on its privatized utility systems and (2) the extent to which DOD has established cybersecurity requirements for its industrial control systems. GAO reviewed DOD guidance and policies and interviewed DOD officials. GAO also reviewed nine utility privatization contracts that were privatized and two contracts privatized two utility systems. What GAO Found The Department of Defense (DOD) has information about utility systems that have been privatized, but it has not tracked utilities privatization contract performance or developed measurable performance standards for these contracts. For the nine utilities privatization contracts in GAO's sample, the military departments have some information on the costs for utility infrastructure improvements and commodities, system reliability, and contractor performance evaluations. However, none of the military departments measure actual cost avoidance over time, and some utilities privatization contracts have experienced cost increases. For example, the Army estimated at the time of contract award that it would have cost the Army $61.4 million to provide natural gas utility services over the life of the utilities privatization contract, while the successful proposal from the contractor estimated a cost of $52.3 million for the same services. However, none of the military departments measure actual cost avoidance over time, and some utilities privatization contracts have experienced cost increases. Specifically, six of the nine utilities privatization contracts in GAO's sample included modifications, which increased the original cost of the contract by more than 5 percent after adjusting for inflation. In addition, the military departments have not used contractor-provided data to determine reliability trends over time. Without issuing guidance that requires the military departments and the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) to develop and implement metrics and measurable performance standards to track contract performance for future utilities privatization contracts and to develop similar guidance for current utilities privatization contracts, the department will lack information on the performance of utilities privatization contracts. Without issuing guidance that requires the military departments and DLA to develop and implement metrics and measurable performance standards to track contract performance for future utilities privatization contracts and to develop similar",

USPS has a history of declining capital spending, and USPS has recently undertaken more capital spending than expected on information technology and other capital projects. GAO was asked to review USPS's capital spending. This report (1) describes USPS's projected capital spending over the next 10 years and (2) assesses whether USPS's processes support its ability to address uncertainties and risks that affect its capital spending. GAO reviewed USPS data on capital spending from fiscal years 2007 through 2017 and USPS documentation on projected capital spending from fiscal years 2018 through 2028. GAO also interviewed USPS officials and reviewed a non-generalizable sample of 14 Decision Analysis Reports (DARs) for selected projects. What GAO Found The U.S. Postal Service (USPS) projects an annual average of $2.4 billion in capital spending from fiscal years 2018 through 2028\u2014about 70 percent more than the average of $1.4 billion from fiscal years 2007 through 2017. USPS projects an annual average of about $821 million in capital spending for vehicles, primarily driven by a multi-year acquisition of new delivery vehicles starting in fiscal year 2019. USPS officials said USPS decided a number of years ago to defer purchasing new delivery vehicles and instead continued using and maintaining its existing fleet. USPS projects an annual average of about $607 million in capital spending for facilities, which includes the replacement of roofs or heating, ventilation, and air-conditioning systems needed to sustain operations. USPS projects an annual average of about $464 million in capital spending for mail-processing equipment, which includes new control systems for about 1,000 bar code sorters. USPS has processes that can help it identify uncertainties and risks that could affect its capital spending and adjust its spending to changing circumstances. USPS has adopted the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission's internal control framework, which includes how organizations should address uncertainties and risks.

    "gao_GAO-18-115": "Why GAO Did This Study The Justice for All Reauthorization Act of 2016 included provisions that would expand federal courts' authority to order restitution for victims of federal crimes. This report examines the extent to which (1) federal courts have the authority to order restitution for victims of federal crimes and (2) stakeholders have identified factors that could affect the potential expansion of federal courts' authority to order restitution. GAO reviewed relevant laws, regulations, and guidance; analyzed DOJ data on restitution imposed by the federal courts from fiscal years 1996 through 2016; and interviewed DOJ, USSC, and other stakeholders. What GAO Found According to the U.S. Courts' data for fiscal years 1996 through 2016, the percentage of offenders ordered to pay restitution by federal courts has remained fairly steady. From fiscal years 1996 through 2016, an average of 15 percent of individual offenders and 32 percent of organizational offenders annually were ordered to pay restitution by the federal courts. Stakeholders GAO interviewed identified various factors related to the potential expansion of federal courts' authority to order restitution in the four areas listed in the Justice for All Reauthorization Act of 2016: (1) to apply to victims who have suffered harm, injury, or loss that would not have occurred but for the defendant's related conduct; (2) in the case of an offense resulting in the victim's death, to allow the court to use its discretion to award the income lost by the victim's surviving family members or estate as a result of the victim's death; (3) to require that the defendant pay to the victim an amount determined by the court to restore the victim to the position he or she would have been in had the defendant not committed the offense; and (4) to require the defendant compensate the victim for any injury, harm, or loss, including emotional distress, that occurred as a result of the offense. Stakeholders also identified additional factors to consider, beyond the ones identified for the four provisions above, for potential broadening of courts' authority to order restitution generally. For example, if federal courts' authority were to be expanded to allow a defendant's related conduct to be included in an order for restitution, there would be increased complexity to determine losses for restitution. For example, DOJ officials stated that inclusion of a defendant's related conduct would allow restitution to be open to a larger pool of",

However, as GAO has previously reported, investments in federal IT too often result in failed projects that incur cost overruns and schedule slippages, while contributing little to the desired mission-related outcomes. FITARA was intended to improve agencies' acquisitions of IT and enable Congress to monitor agencies' progress and hold them accountable for reducing duplication and achieving cost savings. This testimony is based on GAO's prior work on FITARA and related federal IT initiatives. It is based on prior GAO reports issued from July 2011 through August 2017, selected updates conducted in August 2016, and selected updates conducted in November 2017. GAO also convened a forum to explore challenges and opportunities for chief information officers (CIO) to improve federal IT acquisitions and operations. What GAO Found The Federal Information Technology Acquisition Reform Act (FITARA) was intended to improve agencies' acquisitions of information technology (IT) and enable Congress to monitor agencies' progress and hold them accountable for reducing duplication and achieving cost savings. The law includes specific requirements related to seven areas. For example, the law requires OMB to develop a goal for how much is to be saved through this initiative, and provide annual reports on cost savings achieved. In addition, in June 2015, OMB released guidance describing how agencies are to implement FITARA. The guidance also directs agencies to develop a data center consolidation and optimization strategic plan that defines the agency's data center strategy for fiscal years 2016, 2017, and 2018. As of November 2016, all agencies had made their plans publicly available. In addition, in August 2016, OMB released guidance intended to, among other things, define a framework for achieving the data center consolidation and optimization requirements of FITARA. The guidance also directs agencies to develop a data center consolidation and optimization strategic plan that defines the agency's data center strategy for fiscal years 2016, 2017, and 2018. As of November 2017, all agencies had made their plans publicly available. Congress has recognized the importance of agencies' continued implementation of FITARA provisions, and has taken legislative action to extend selected provisions beyond their original dates of expiration. For example, Congress has passed legislation to: remove the expiration date for enhanced transparency and improved risk management provisions, which were set to expire in 2019; remove the expiration date for portfolio review, which was set to expire in 2019;",
    "gao_GAO-18-418": "Why GAO Did This Study IRS authenticates taxpayers to provide reasonable assurance that it is interacting with the legitimate taxpayer. Authentication is particularly important for combatting identity theft refund fraud, which occurs when a fraudster obtains an individual's Social Security number, date of birth, or other personal information and uses it to file a fraudulent tax return seeking a refund. GAO was asked to review IRS's efforts to improve its authentication methods. This report (1) describes the taxpayer interactions that require authentication, including the general rationale behind the requirements, and IRS's authentication methods; (2) assesses what IRS is doing to monitor and improve its authentication methods, both internally and collaboratively through the Security Summit, to secure taxpayer information and reduce identity theft refund fraud; and (3) evaluates what else, if anything, IRS can do to strengthen its authentication methods while improving services to taxpayers. GAO reviewed IRS documents and data on taxpayer authentication volumes and per transaction costs for fiscal years 2016 and 2017, and interviewed IRS officials. What GAO Found The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) authenticates millions of taxpayers via telephone, online, in-person, or correspondence to verify potentially fraudulent tax returns, provide taxpayers access to a tax transcript, or issue a replacement identity protection personal identification number (IP PIN). IRS's cost to authenticate taxpayers varies widely, with in-person authentication at a Taxpayer Assistance Center costing about $89 per interaction and online authentication costing less than $1 per interaction. IRS has made progress on its authentication efforts, but has not articulated relative priorities for the foundational initiatives supporting its strategic efforts or the resources it will require to complete them. IRS's 2016 Roadmap outlines six core authentication objectives, followed by 10 high-level strategic efforts, and 14 foundational initiatives to help address its most pressing authentication challenges. However, IRS has not articulated the resources it will need to complete its foundational initiatives and their supporting activities. For example, IRS has not identified funding for the initiative's other supporting activities, such as developing requirements to send push notifications to taxpayers, and implementing them will depend on the availability of future resources. IRS has made limited progress in identifying risks and establishing internal controls for telephone, in-person, and correspondence authentication.

In 2015, DOD created the Journal Voucher Working Group (Working Group) to address the issue of unsupported journal vouchers (JV) in the Army's general fund. GAO was asked to review the Working Group's efforts to address unsupported JVs. This report (1) describes the extent to which the Working Group has (1) performed analyses to determine the root causes of unsupported JVs and (2) developed and monitored the implementation of corrective action plans to address identified root causes of unsupported JVs. GAO reviewed relevant reports and reports, analyzed the Working Group's documentation of corrective action plans, and interviewed agency officials. What GAO Found The Working Group has been actively working toward implementing new processes to support JVs and eliminate unsupported JVs in the Army's general fund. From October 2016 to March 2017, the Working Group, based on Defense Finance and Accounting Service (DFAS)-produced metrics, reported that it had identified more than 121,000 unsupported JVs totaling $455 billion. The Working Group prioritized its identifying of root causes of unsupported JVs based upon factors such as potential correction complexity, materiality, and volume. In the May 2017 Financial Improvement and Audit Readiness (FIAR) Plan Status Report, DOD stated that the Army had completed its root cause analyses for all JVs. However, GAO found that the analyses have been performed on only a small percentage of the total number of unsupported JVs that existed as of March 2017 and cannot be considered completed for all unsupported JVs. In addition, members of the Working Group confirmed as of June 2017 that the Working Group has not yet performed all analyses necessary and stated that the Working Group's efforts will be an ongoing, iterative process because of anticipated new challenges that continually arise from new business processes or programs. As of March 2017, the Working Group had not included in its root cause analyses (1) any unsupported JVs at the transaction level, such as within the General Fund Enterprise Business System, which are mostly attributed to year-end closing accounting entries; (2) any unsupported JVs within the Defense Departmental Reporting System-Budgetary, which are used to prepare the financial statements; or (3) system-generated JVs.

As a territory, Puerto Rico is subject to congressional authority, though Congress has granted it broad authority over matters of internal governance\u2014notably, by approving Puerto Rico's constitution in 1952. Individuals born in Puerto Rico are U.S. citizens and can migrate freely to the states. Puerto Rico and its residents are generally subject to the same federal laws as the states and their residents, except in cases where specific exemptions have been made, such as with certain federal programs. In addition, Puerto Rico's economy is in a prolonged period of economic contraction. GAO was asked to review Puerto Rico's financial condition and levels of debt. This report describes (1) the factors that contributed to Puerto Rico's financial condition and levels of debt; and (2) federal actions that could address the factors that contributed to Puerto Rico's financial condition and levels of debt. GAO reviewed relevant literature and interviewed current and former Puerto Rico officials, federal officials, and other relevant experts. GAO also reviewed a nongeneralizable sample of Puerto Rico bonds prospectuses issued between 2000 and 2017 from the Electronic Municipal Market Access database of the Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board. GAO also interviewed current and former Puerto Rico officials and experts on Puerto Rico's economy, the municipal securities markets, state and territorial budgeting and debt management, and selected industry groups in Puerto Rico. What GAO Found Based on interviews with current and former Puerto Rico officials, federal officials, and other relevant experts, as well as a review of relevant literature, the factors that contributed to Puerto Rico's financial condition and levels of debt related to: (1) Puerto Rico's government running persistent deficits and (2) its use of debt to cope with deficits. Puerto Rico's government has operated with a deficit in all years since 2002, and deficits grew over time. To cope with its persistent deficits, Puerto Rico's government issued debt to finance operations, rather than reduce its fiscal gap by cutting spending, raising taxes, or both.

The Coast Guard operates about 700 boats and about 200 aircraft. GAO was asked to review the Coast Guard's efforts to close unneeded stations. This report examines the extent to which the Coast Guard has (1) a sound process for analyzing the need for its boat stations, (2) a sound process to analyze the need for its air stations and air facilities, and (3) actions to implement the results of its analyses of its need for its boat stations and air facilities. GAO reviewed laws, policies, and procedures related to its search and rescue (SAR) mission; analyzed Coast Guard data on SAR caseloads by station for fiscal years 2010 through 2016; and interviewed Coast Guard officials. What GAO Found The U.S. Coast Guard (Coast Guard) has a sound process for analyzing the need for its boat stations that is consistent with GAO's Program Evaluation guidance, which calls for choosing well-regarded criteria against which to make comparisons in order to achieve strong, defensible conclusions. The primary criteria Coast Guard subject matter experts established, consistent with statutory requirements that the Coast Guard make a determination that adequate search and rescue (SAR) coverage would remain in place, were (1) a minimum threshold of overlapping SAR coverage had to be maintained and (2) the Coast Guard's ability to meet its nationwide 2-hour SAR response standard had to be maintained. By applying these criteria, the Coast Guard's process identified overlapping search and rescue coverage where three or more stations can respond to a single SAR case within 2 hours, and unnecessary duplication where stations could be closed without negatively impacting the Coast Guard's ability to meet mission requirements, such as its 2-hour SAR response standard. In April 2013, the Coast Guard initiated its 9-step Station Optimization Process to analyze its boat stations, and the results identified 18 stations that could be closed because they provide overlapping and unnecessarily duplicative SAR coverage. The Coast Guard hired a contractor to carry out the analysis and identify potential cost savings from permanent closures of such stations. Although focused on SAR coverage, the process also included consideration of all Coast Guard missions carried out at these stations. The contractor followed the",
    "gao_GAO-18-609SP": "Why GAO Did This Study GAO has reported that federal managers do not consistently apply data-driven decision making practices. GAO was asked to review the use of performance information in federal decision making. This report assesses the extent to which (1) the reported use of performance information and related leading practices at 24 agencies has changed compared to GAO's prior survey in 2013; (2) managers' reported use of performance information and related leading practices has improved; and (3) the Executive Branch has taken actions to enhance agencies' use of performance information in various decision making activities. GAO analyzed agency-level data from a stratified random sample of 4,395 mid- and upper-level civilian managers and supervisors at 24 agencies. GAO also interviewed OMB and PIC staff about any actions they have taken, or planned to take, to further support the use of performance information across the federal government. What GAO Found GAO's 2017 survey of federal managers showed that the reported use of performance information at most agencies did not change from 2013 to 2017\u2014a trend that is comparable to GAO's prior survey in 2013. Specifically, 3 of the 24 agencies had statistically significant changes in their index scores\u20141 increase (National Science Foundation) and 2 decreases (Social Security Administration and the Office of Personnel Management). Also, 6 agencies had results that were statistically significantly different\u20144 higher and 2 lower\u2014than the government-wide average. Despite these two increases, the overall results suggest these practices are not widely followed government-wide. For example, on most of the 10 survey questions, only about half (or fewer) of the managers reported their agencies were following them to a \"great\" or \"very great\" extent. GAO's past work has found that the Executive Branch has taken steps to improve the use of performance information in decision making by senior leaders at federal agencies. However, GAO's survey results indicate those steps have not led to similar improvements in use by managers at lower levels. GPRAMA's requirements, and the federal performance management framework established by OMB's guidance, apply at the agency-wide level and generally involve senior leaders. GAO's past work also found that agencies made progress in implementing these reviews and using performance information. In July 2015, GAO found that agencies generally were conducting their data-driven reviews in line with GPRAMA requirements and GAO's related leading practices, including that agency leaders used the reviews",

GAO also reviewed relevant federal laws and guidance, and interviewed Bureau officials. What GAO Found The U.S. Census Bureau (Bureau) plans to rely heavily on both new and legacy information technology (IT) systems and infrastructure to support the 2018 End-to-End Test and the 2020 Census operations. For example, the Bureau plans to deploy and use 43 systems in the 2018 End-to-End Test. Eleven of these systems are being developed or modified as part of an enterprise-wide initiative called Census Enterprise Data Collection and Processing (CEDCaP), which is managed within the Bureau's IT Directorate. The Bureau plans to incrementally deploy and use the 43 systems for nine operations from December 2016 through the end of the test in April 2019. These nine operations are: (1) in-office address canvassing, (2) recruiting staff for address canvassing, (3) training for address canvassing, (4) in-field address canvassing, (5) recruiting staff for field enumeration, (6) training for field enumeration, (7) self-response (i.e., Internet, phone, or paper), (8) field enumeration, and (9) tabulation and dissemination.

The UPU has not covered USPS's costs to deliver inbound mail since fiscal year 1998. The UPU has proposed changes to the terminal dues system to address the growing volume of international mail handled by USPS. GAO was asked to review the effects of the changes on domestic stakeholders. This report describes the financial effects on domestic stakeholders of (1) the rates under the current UPU terminal dues system, (2) planned changes to those rates, and (3) alternatives to the terminal dues system. GAO analyzed USPS data on inbound and outbound international mail from fiscal years 2012 through 2016, including volume, costs, and revenue data; reviewed relevant federal statutes and U.S. policies; and interviewed officials at USPS, PRC, and State. What GAO Found The U.S. Postal Service (USPS) has generated positive net revenue from all terminal dues mail, which has increased from fiscal year 2012 to fiscal year 2016. This occurred even though losses from inbound mail more than doubled from $66 million to $135 million from fiscal year 2012 to fiscal year 2016. Net revenue for outbound terminal dues mail increased during the same time period. According to stakeholders GAO interviewed as well as GAO's economic analysis, U.S. businesses that send outbound international mail and U.S. consumers also benefit from the current terminal dues system similar to USPS. These stakeholders benefit for the following reasons: U.S. businesses that send outbound terminal dues mail, for example, may pay lower postal rates than what would be set by the destination country's designated postal operator to deliver that mail. This is the case for mail sent to many developed countries, such as in Europe, where most U.S. outbound international mail is sent. In this case, the postage charged by USPS to the business reflects the relatively low terminal dues rate paid by USPS to those designated postal operators, rather than a higher rate that better reflects the designated postal operator's delivery costs. The current terminal dues system also creates competitive disadvantages for other U.S. stakeholders, such as ECOs, which collect, transport, and deliver documents and packages sent",

GAO was asked to update its model update to simulate the sector's long-term fiscal outlook. This report (1) describes the sector's long-term fiscal outlook and (2) examines how changes in federal tax and health-related policies could affect the sector's long-term fiscal outlook. GAO simulated the sector's fiscal outlook from 2018 through 2092 using historical data and alternative assumptions about economic growth, health care excess cost growth, and the rate of return on pension assets. GAO also interviewed officials from the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), and the Board of Governors of the Federal Old-Age and Survivors Insurance and Federal Disability Insurance Trust Funds. What GAO Found GAO's simulations suggest that the state and local government sector will likely continue to face a difference between revenue and spending during the next 50 years. This long-term outlook is measured by the operating balance\u2014a measure of the sector's ability to cover its current expenditures out of current receipts. While both expenditures and revenues are projected to increase as a percentage of gross domestic product (GDP) during the simulation period, a difference between the two is projected to persist because expenditures are generally expected to grow at a faster rate than revenues. GAO's simulations suggest that state and local governments will need to make policy changes to avoid fiscal imbalances before then and assure that revenues are at least equal to expenditures.

Section 813 also required DOD to include among the revisions the DFARS requires to include in the revisions the lowest price offered reflected full life-cycle costs. GAO was asked to review DOD's use of LPTA procedures. This report examines (1) the extent to which DOD used LPTA procedures for IT and support services contracts valued at $10 million or more that were awarded in the first half of fiscal year 2017, and (2) factors DOD officials considered when determining to use LPTA procedures in the 7 selected contracts GAO reviewed.

Of these 781 contracts, 133 contracts were awarded for IT and support services. However, only 9 of the 133 contracts used LPTA source selection procedures. Contracting officials cited a number of factors that were considered when determining to use LPTA procedures in the 7 selected contracts GAO reviewed. For all of the contracts, officials determined that the government would not receive a benefit for paying more than the lowest price. For the 7 contracts, contracting officials also stated that LPTA procedures were used, in part, because the requirements were well-defined, non-complex, or reoccurring. For the Air Force, contracting officials stated that LPTA procedures were used, in part, because the requirements were well-defined, non-complex, or reoccurring. For the",

The NDAA for Fiscal Year 2016 included provisions requiring DOD to perform certain activities aimed at ensuring that its business system investments are managed efficiently and effectively. The act also required DOD to develop and maintain a business enterprise architecture and information technology (IT) enterprise architecture. The act also required DOD to establish a Defense Business Council to provide advice to the Secretary on managing defense business systems. GAO was asked to review DOD's management of its business systems. This report assesses the extent to which DOD has (1) established guidance for effectively managing its defense business systems; (2) developed and maintained a business enterprise architecture and IT enterprise architecture, in accordance with relevant laws and Office of Management and Budget (OMB) policies and guidance; (3) used the Defense Business Council to provide advice to the Secretary on developing the business enterprise architecture, reengineering the department's business processes, developing and deploying business systems, and developing requirements for business systems; and (4) ensured that covered business systems are reviewed and certified in accordance with the act. GAO reviewed DOD guidance and documentation, and interviewed cognizant officials. What GAO Found The Department of Defense (DOD) has taken steps to address provisions of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2016 related to defense business system investments. Specifically, the act required DOD to issue guidance by December 31, 2016 to provide for the coordination of, and decision making for, the planning, programming, and control of investments in covered defense business systems.

    "gao_GAO-18-270": "Why GAO Did This Study The IG Act of 1978, as amended (IG Act), established OIGs to conduct and supervise audits and investigations relating to the programs and operations of government establishments. The IG Act also sets out, among other things, (1) the duties and responsibilities of each IG with respect to the entity within which its office is established; (2) how IGs are appointed, whether by the President with the advice and consent of the Senate, or by the head of the DFE; and (3) the processes for removing an IG. GAO was asked to review the IG Act. This report (1) determines the status of IG vacancies as of the end of fiscal year 2017, and the number and duration of the IG vacancies for fiscal years 2007 through 2016, and (2) provides views of the IG community on the impacts, if any, of IG vacancies on the OIG's ability to effectively carry out their duties, including independence and permanent IG suggestions for improvements in the appointment process. GAO analyzed vacancy data from the 64 active OIGs established under the IG Act, reviewed and summarized vacancy data, and interviewed agency officials. GAO also conducted a web-based survey of 54 IG Act OIGs, and surveyed a stratified random sample of 185 OIG employees. What GAO Found As of September 30, 2017, there were 12 IG vacancies in the 64 active OIGs established under the IG Act. Over the 10-year period covering fiscal years 2007 through 2016, the total number of IG vacancies varied with a low of 6 total vacancies as of the end of fiscal year 2007 to a high of 11 vacancies as of the end of fiscal years 2009, 2014, and 2016. In addition, some OIGs experienced prolonged continuous vacancies ranging from over 1 year to approximately 6 years.

This report examines (1) the population of inmates with and without serious mental illness, (2) the types of crimes committed by inmates with and without serious mental illness, and (3) what is known about the costs to the federal and selected state governments to incarcerate and provide mental health services to incarcerated individuals with serious mental illness. GAO analyzed federal and state data on the number of inmates with and without serious mental illness, and selected states' data on the costs of providing mental health services. GAO also interviewed officials from the Department of Justice's (DOJ) Office of Justice Programs and the Department of Health and Human Services' (HHS) Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administrations and the National Institute of Mental Health. GAO also reviewed relevant literature and interviewed officials from federal and selected state governments and mental health organizations. What GAO Found About two-thirds of Federal Bureau of Prison (BOP) inmates with a serious mental illness were incarcerated for four types of offenses\u2014drug offenses (23 percent), sex offenses (18 percent), weapons and explosives offenses (17 percent), and robbery (8 percent). The most common types of crimes committed by inmates with serious mental illness varied from state to state. For example, the New York State Department of Corrections and Community Supervision (DOCCS) cared for 2,513 inmates with serious mental illness out of a total of 51,436 inmates as of December 31, 2016. The Virginia Department of Corrections cared for 527 inmates with serious mental illness out of a total of 30,052 inmates as of September 29, 2017. The most common types of crimes committed by inmates with serious mental illness varied from state to state. The difference in types of crimes reported by states and BOP may be due to different priorities, laws, and enforcement priorities across the state and federal criminal justice systems, among other things. The federal and state governments also define serious mental illness differently, and they track different categories of crime in their respective data systems. The most common types of crimes reported by inmates with serious mental illness varied from state to state. The difference in types of crimes reported",
    "gao_GAO-19-189": "Why GAO Did This Study JWST is NASA's most expensive and complex science project. The project is to integrate and test the elements, major subsystems, and software necessary to operate the telescope. In May 2018, the JWST Independent Review Panel reported that the JWST project had made progress in completing integration and test, but that the project had experienced significant cost growth and schedule delays. GAO was asked to review JWST. This report examines (1) the JWST program's history of cost growth and schedule delays, (2) the extent to which the JWST project has used its cost and schedule commitments to reflect prior and ongoing technical challenges, and (3) the extent to which NASA has taken steps to augment oversight of the contractor and project. GAO reviewed NASA documents and interviewed NASA officials and other stakeholders. What GAO Found The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) program has a history of significant schedule delays and increases to project costs, which resulted in replans in 2011 and 2018. Before 2011, early technical and management challenges, contractor performance issues, low levels of cost reserves, and poorly phased funding caused the JWST program to delay work. As a result, the program experienced schedule overruns, including launch delays, and cost growth. In June 2018, after a series of launch delay announcements due to technical and workmanship issues identified during spacecraft element integration, NASA notified Congress that it had again revised the JWST program's cost and schedule estimates. NASA estimated that it now required $828 million in additional resources and 29 more months to complete beyond those estimates agreed to in the 2011 rebaseline. As of November 2018, NASA had funding to continue to execute the program and was waiting to see if Congress would authorize the program's continuation and appropriate funds for the program in fiscal year 2019. To develop a new schedule for JWST's 2018 replan, NASA took into account the remaining integration and test work and added time to the schedule to address threats that were not yet mitigated. This includes 5.5 months to address an anomaly that occurred on the sunshield's cover in 2018. The project also replenished its schedule reserves\u2014which GAO found in February 2018 had been consumed\u2014so that they now exceed the recommended levels. Both the project and the Independent Review Panel conducted schedule risk assessments that produced similar launch dates. The project relied on the replan schedule to determine",

State's CSCP is intended to replace embassies that do not meet security standards. GAO was asked to review State's embassy construction program. This report examines (1) the pace of State's CSCP in constructing new embassies, (2) the cost and schedule performance of State's recent embassy construction projects, and (3) factors that have affected State's ability to deliver construction projects efficiently. GAO reviewed State's CSCP project completion data and budget documents, surveyed State staff, and interviewed State officials. What GAO Found The Department of State's (State) Capital Security Construction Program (CSCP) has fallen short of its 2005 target of constructing 150 new embassies by 2018, a milestone that the 2005 cost-sharing was intended to facilitate. State completed 77 new embassies and had 21 under construction. In fiscal year 2017, State forecasted a potential need for 72 additional embassies beyond those completed or under construction. State's CSCP will not achieve the 2005 target of constructing 150 new embassies by 2018, a milestone that the 2005 cost-sharing was intended to facilitate. This is due, in part, to unexpected building requirements and the effects of inflation. In 2012, recognizing the erosion of purchasing power as a result of inflation, the Benghazi Accountability Review Board recommended that State work with Congress to increase the CSCP's annual funding level from $1.4 billion to approximately $2.2 billion in fiscal year 2015 and for up to 10 years thereafter. OBO plans to begin construction of 25 embassies in fiscal years 2018\u20132022 and nearly 50 more beyond fiscal year 2022, but it is unclear whether OBO can maintain its average pace of 5 new embassy contract awards per year\u2014particularly as State has not defined the overall capital cost and potential timeframes needed to achieve this goal, nor does it currently expect to seek year-to-year adjustments for inflation. Without information on the projected pace of construction and estimated effects of inflation, stakeholders' may lack complete information to make fully-informed budget decisions.

    "gao_GAO-18-296": "Why GAO Did This Study The U.S. cattle industry is an important part of the nation's agricultural sector and contributes tens of billions of dollars to the U.S. economy. GAO was asked to review the U.S. cattle market. This report (1) describes key factors that affected fed cattle price changes from 2013 through 2016 and (2) describes what CFTC found about possible trading irregularities in the futures market for fed cattle in 2015 and any changes to the futures contract for fed cattle since 2015; and (3) examines factors that may affect USDA's routine monitoring to ensure against discriminatory or anticompetitive practices in the fed cattle market. GAO analyzed USDA data on cattle transactions from 2013 through 2015, reviewed relevant statutes and regulations, and interviewed USDA and CFTC officials. What GAO Found GAO's review identified several supply and demand factors that affected the large national changes in fed cattle prices from 2013 through 2016. These factors included a prolonged drought that affected the supply of young cattle and the availability of relatively less expensive protein substitutes, such as pork, that affected changes in fed cattle prices from 2013 through 2016. Furthermore, GAO found that varying competition levels among packers did not appear to explain the large national changes in fed cattle prices but may have contributed to variations in fed cattle prices in different areas of the country. Specifically, at the national level, packer competition levels were stable from 2013 through 2015. However, variations in competition levels in different areas of the country may have contributed to variations in fed cattle prices in different areas of the country. Specifically, at the national level, packer competition levels were stable from 2013 through 2015. Using an econometric model, GAO found that less packer competition in any given area was associated with lower fed cattle prices in that area. Specifically, GAO found that less packer competition in any given area was associated with lower fed cattle prices in that area. Evidence of this effect alone does not imply that packers engaged in anticompetitive or improper behavior. USDA's view of its legal authority does not allow P&SP routine access to the data from the Agricultural Marketing Service's (AMS) price reporting group on daily transactions between packers and cattle feeders. USDA officials told GAO that it was too early in the reorganization process to determine whether AMS leadership would view routine sharing of these data any differently.

In fiscal years 2014 through 2017, Congress directed that not less than certain specified amounts, totaling $271 million, be made available to combat wildlife trafficking. GAO was asked to review wildlife trafficking in the United States and Asia. This report examines (1) what is known about the demand for illegal wildlife and wildlife products in the United States and in Asia, (2) actions agencies are taking to reduce demand for illegal wildlife products in the United States and Asia, and (3) the extent to which the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) within the Department of the Interior (DOI), the U.S. Department of State (State), and the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) are assessing the effectiveness of their combating wildlife trafficking activities. GAO reviewed reports and interviewed officials from DOI, State, USAID, and other agencies. GAO also conducted fieldwork in three locations in Asia, selected based on geographic diversity and other factors. What GAO Found The United States, China, and countries in Southeast Asia consume many types of illegally traded wildlife for diverse purposes. It is difficult to measure demand for illegal wildlife and wildlife products due to the illicit nature of the trade, but various data sources and reports provide examples of the range of wildlife demand by illustrating types of wildlife that are seized by governments and purchased by consumers. For example, from 2007 to 2016, FWS confiscated more than one-third of the wildlife shipments seized nationally by FWS. In addition, from 2007 to 2016, FWS confiscated more than one-third of the wildlife shipments seized by FWS while being imported from or exported to Mexico (13.6 percent), China (13 percent), Canada (8.6 percent), and other locations. Demand for illegally traded wildlife in China and countries in Southeast Asia includes many wildlife species and end uses, according to reports and government and nongovernmental organizations (NGO) officials in the region. For example, iconic wildlife such as elephants and rhinos are often cited in reports and by officials in the field as examples of wildlife consumption in China and Southeast Asia, but other wildlife, such as pangolins, bears, sharks, and sea turtles are also named among the wildlife being consumed. In the United States, agencies have worked together to combat wildlife trafficking, but disagreement on roles and responsibilities has",
    "gao_GAO-18-403": "Why GAO Did This Study FAA is responsible for regulating the safety of civil aviation in the United States, including the administration of pilot certification (licensing) and conducting safety oversight of pilot training. FAA-certificated collegiate aviation schools are required to meet prescribed standards with respect to training equipment, facilities, student records, personnel, and curriculum. GAO was asked to review collegiate aviation schools' ability to produce professional pilots. This report addresses (1) what is known about collegiate aviation schools with professional pilot degree programs in terms of location, types of training programs available, and enrollment; and (2) challenges that affect collegiate aviation schools' ability to produce professional pilots and schools' response to these challenges. GAO analyzed FAA's pilot certificate and instrument rating data, reviewed relevant federal laws and regulations, and interviewed FAA officials, representatives of airports, flight training providers, and other aviation stakeholders. What GAO Found GAO identified 147 U.S. colleges and universities that offered at least one professional pilot degree program in academic year 2015-2016. These schools are located throughout the country and offer different types of pilot degree programs. About three-quarters of collegiate aviation schools are public (110 out of 145), while the remainder are either private non-profits or private for-profits. FAA requires collegiate aviation schools to meet prescribed standards, have structured programs, and FAA must approve their pilot program's curriculum. FAA-certificated collegiate aviation schools are not subject to periodic FAA inspections, and enrollment data are limited. FAA-certificated collegiate aviation schools reported average yearly enrollment data for their pilot programs in academic year 2015\u20132016. However, of the 147 schools GAO identified, 72 reported pilot student graduates using the Aviation Accreditation Board International program code. Selected school and other aviation industry representatives GAO spoke with generally agreed that retaining and recruiting flight instructors is one of the key challenges facing collegiate aviation schools. Representatives from nearly all (16 of 18) of the schools identified recruiting and retaining flight instructors as a great or moderate challenge and a majority stated that it was their greatest challenge affecting their ability to produce pilots. Flight instructors generally seek employment with an airline as soon as they accrue the minimum flight hours required by FAA, according to representatives from three aviation industry stakeholders.

The program is intended to replace aging aircraft and provide a more reliable and capable aircraft for combat. The program is estimated to cost about $44.4 billion and will cost about $7.3 billion over the next 5 years. The program is expected to meet 21 performance goals, including a fuel usage rate target of 89 percent of the time. The program also expects to meet all of its 21 performance goals. The program is currently working to resolve a high-priority deficiency related to the performance of the aerial refueling boom that it discovered during testing. The program also expects to deliver 18 fully capable aircraft by October 2018, if risks are not mitigated. GAO was asked to review the KC-46 program. This report examines (1) the program's cost, schedule, and performance outcomes and (2) the extent to which development problems have resulted in delivery delays and kept the Air Force from achieving a higher level of refueling capacity it expected to achieve by this time. GAO reviewed program documents and interviewed program officials. What GAO Found The KC-46 program's total acquisition cost estimate remained stable over the past year at $44.4 billion, which is about $7.3 billion less than the original estimate. In addition, the aircraft is projected to meet all performance capabilities. However, Boeing is currently trying to resolve a critical deficiency it discovered in testing, which could affect performance. The program expects to meet all of its 21 performance goals. For example, the aircraft is expected to be ready for operational use when required at least 89 percent of the time and, once it is deployed for an aerial refueling mission, be able to complete that mission 92 percent of the time. However, Boeing is currently working to resolve a critical deficiency it discovered in testing, which could affect performance. Boeing is currently working to resolve a high-priority deficiency related to the performance of the aerial refueling boom that it discovered during testing.

    "gao_GAO-18-117": "Why GAO Did This Study The federal government has a long-standing process for determining the eligibility of individuals for access to classified information. Continuous evaluation is intended to fill the information gap between investigative cycles to identify risks to national security. GAO was asked to review the implementation of continuous evaluation across the executive branch. This report examines, among other things, (1) the extent to which ODNI has implemented continuous evaluation across the executive branch, and (2) the extent to which executive branch agencies have established timeliness goals for completing periodic reinvestigations. GAO reviewed ODNI documents and data, and interviewed officials from ODNI, DOD, OMB, State, and State. What GAO Found The Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI) has taken an initial step to implement continuous evaluation across the executive branch in a phased approach, but it has not yet formalized the program in policy. Specifically, in October 2016, ODNI initiated the first phase of continuous evaluation and outlined requirements for this phase in interim guidance distributed to implementing agencies in December 2016. For the first phase of implementation, executive branch agencies are to conduct certain continuous evaluation record checks against a portion of their national security population. ODNI provided agencies with prioritization guidance to help them select individuals for continuous evaluation. Nearly 80 executive branch agencies are subject to the requirements for this first phase of implementation. ODNI officials stated that they have not yet issued a government-wide policy or an expanded definition of continuous evaluation. As a result, agencies may develop inconsistent approaches to implementing continuous evaluation. ODNI has not yet determined key aspects of its continuous evaluation program, which has limited the ability of executive branch agencies to plan for implementation in accordance with ODNI's phased approach. For example, while ODNI has initiated the first phase of continuous evaluation in coordination with implementing agencies, it has not yet determined what the future phases of implementation will entail, or when they will occur. Moreover, ODNI has not set any further timeframes for implementing continuous evaluation or determined agency requirements for future phases. ODNI officials stated that because continuous evaluation is a new initiative, no realistic timeline for full implementation will be set until the initial results of implementation are analyzed and technical capabilities have matured. Further, ODNI lacks plans for monitoring and measuring the performance of continuous evaluation across the executive branch. OD",
    "gao_GAO-18-450": "Why GAO Did This Study The PAIMI Act provides grants to state PAIMI programs to protect and advocate for individuals with mental illness. The act also requires that GAO review program effectiveness. This report examines (1) the extent to which selected state PAIMI programs have resolved and prevented abuse, neglect, and rights violations of individuals with significant mental illness, and (2) the extent to which SAMHSA oversees program effectiveness. GAO reviewed program performance reports and program documentation, and interviewed SAMHSA officials. GAO also reviewed SAMHSA procedures for monitoring program compliance with statutory and regulatory requirements. What GAO Found The eight selected state Protection and Advocacy for Individuals with Mental Illness (PAIMI) programs reported resolving a majority of individuals' cases related to alleged abuse, neglect, or rights violations in fiscal year 2016, and they reported concluding a variety of systemic activities, with a significant focus on monitoring and addressing issues of abuse or neglect at facilities. Through their work with individuals and completion of systemic activities, the selected programs reported meeting a majority of their priority goals and objectives. SAMHSA has controls in place for monitoring the PAIMI programs' compliance with statutory and regulatory requirements through its ongoing and periodic in-depth monitoring activities. GAO found evidence that SAMHSA had identified and resolved a variety of compliance issues through these activities. For example, SAMHSA followed up with one program in which the advisory council had failed to meet the threshold of 60 percent of its membership being individuals who have received or are receiving mental health services, or are family members of such individuals. SAMHSA also has procedures to oversee state PAIMI program compliance during its periodic onsite monitoring reviews. GAO identified two weaknesses that could be limiting SAMHSA's oversight of program effectiveness. First, SAMHSA's PAIMI program monitoring did not consistently record changes to program priority goals, objectives, and targets\u2014collectively, \"benchmarks\"\u2014made during a performance year, and the agency did not have procedures for examining such changes over time. Second, the agency did not provide timely information to programs on identified deficiencies from onsite monitoring. As of March 2018, SAMHSA was in the process of implementing new processes for its oversight of state PAIMI programs that officials believe will streamline the agency's monitoring activities. However, these changes may not fully address the weaknesses GAO identified.",
    "gao_GAO-18-556T": "Why GAO Did This Study The 340B Program, which is administered by the Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA), provides discounts on outpatient drugs to eligible entities. The 340B Program is governed by HRSA guidance. The 340B price for a drug is based on a statutory formula and represents the highest price a participating drug manufacturer may charge covered entities. The 340B Program also allows covered entities to use drugs purchased at the 340B price for all individuals who meet the 340B Program definition of a patient regardless of whether they are low-income, uninsured, or underinsured. This statement is based on GAO's September 2011 report, entitled 340B Program: HRSA's Oversight of the Program (GAO-11-84). This statement is based on that report, which was issued in September 2018. GAO reviewed HRSA guidance and interviewed agency officials and stakeholders. What GAO Found In its September 2011 report, GAO found that HRSA's oversight of the 340B Program was weak because it primarily relied on covered entities and manufacturers to police themselves and ensure their own compliance with program requirements. Upon enrollment into the program, HRSA requires participants to self-certify that they will comply with applicable 340B Program requirements and any accompanying agency guidance, and expects participants to develop the procedures necessary to ensure and document compliance, informing HRSA if violations occur. HRSA officials told GAO that covered entities and manufacturers could also monitor each other's compliance with program requirements, but GAO found that, in practice, participants could face limitations to such an approach. Beyond relying on participants' self-policing, GAO also found that HRSA engaged in few activities to oversee the 340B Program and ensure its integrity, which agency officials said was primarily due to funding constraints. Further, although HRSA had the authority to conduct audits of program participants to determine whether program violations had occurred, at the time of GAO's 2011 report, the agency had never conducted such an audit. In response to GAO's 2011 report, HRSA implemented a systematic approach to conducting annual audits of covered entities that is outlined on its website. HRSA audits include entities that are randomly selected based on risk-based criteria (approximately 90 percent of the audits conducted each year), and entities that are targeted",

GAO was asked to review U.S. foreign assistance strategies. This report examines the extent to which foreign assistance strategies address key elements that GAO identified related to alignment of agencies' efforts\u2014specifically, elements related to (1) interagency coordination, (2) strategic integration, and (3) assessment of progress toward strategic goals. GAO reviewed 63 government-wide, agency, multi-agency, regional, sector-specific, and multi-agency strategies that were in effect during 2017. GAO also reviewed agency guidance related to foreign assistance strategies. What GAO Found Many of the 52 foreign assistance strategies that GAO reviewed at least partially addressed the key elements GAO identified related to alignment of foreign assistance strategies, but some did not address these elements. Regarding interagency coordination, 40 percent of the strategies generally identified roles and responsibilities for implementing the strategies, while 33 percent generally identified interagency coordination mechanisms; 23 percent and 38 percent, respectively, did not address these elements. Regarding strategic integration, 58 percent of the strategies GAO reviewed described linkages with U.S. foreign assistance strategies in the same sector and 54 percent generally described linkages with relevant higher- or lower-level U.S. foreign assistance strategies; 21 percent and 25 percent, respectively, did not identify such linkages. Regarding assessment of progress toward strategic goals, almost all of the strategies generally established desired results and a framework of goals and objectives and described activities to achieve results; however, 21 percent did not identify milestones or performance indicators and 21 percent did not outline plans for monitoring and evaluation. GAO also found that the six agencies implementing most U.S. foreign assistance do not have consistent guidance for strategy development that could help ensure their strategies address the key elements GAO identified. For example, State and USAID guidance for strategy development includes many of these elements but does not cover all strategies that these agencies are involved in developing. Additionally, guidance for State's and USAID's joint regional strategies, State's functional bureau strategies, and USAID's country development cooperation strategies does not apply to other State and USAID strategies, such as the joint State-USAID integrated country strategies.",
    "gao_GAO-19-158": "Why GAO Did This Study The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Dodd-Frank Act) requires CFPB to monitor for certain risks to consumers in support of its rulemaking and other functions. The act also requires CFPB to issue at least one report annually of significant findings from its risk monitoring. The act also requires GAO to report on CFPB's efforts to address the act's requirement. This report examines (1) how CFPB monitors consumer financial markets and how it uses its market-monitoring findings to inform policy, and (2) the extent to which CFPB has a systematic, bureau-wide process for prioritizing risks to consumers and considering how it will use its full set of tools to address those risks. GAO reviewed relevant laws, regulations, and CFPB documents; interviewed CFPB officials; and reviewed CFPB's market-monitoring findings and other consumer protection documents. What GAO Found The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) routinely monitors consumer financial markets through a variety of methods, including collecting and analyzing market-related data and conducting outreach to help inform policy. CFPB's Markets Offices collect and monitor routine market data and other market intelligence through a combination of internal and external data sources and outreach. Markets Offices staff use information from these sources to analyze market trends and identify emerging risks that may require greater attention. Staff produce monthly and quarterly reports that summarize or analyze observed market developments and trends, and they distribute them bureau-wide. CFPB also conducts more targeted market monitoring to support rulemaking and other agency functions. For example, in fiscal year 2018, Markets Offices staff conducted an average of about 50 meetings with industry representatives and held intelligence-gathering meetings across various consumer financial markets throughout the year. CFPB also conducts targeted market monitoring to support certain statutory reporting requirements. For example, CFPB used its data-collection authorities under the Dodd-Frank Act to make four mandatory information requests to a total of 15 credit card issuers. In addition, CFPB has sometimes engaged in targeted data collection to learn more about specific areas of potential consumer financial risk. CFPB currently lacks a systematic, bureau-wide process for prioritizing financial risks facing consumers\u2014using information from its market monitoring, among other sources\u2014and for considering how it will use its tools",

GAO also reviewed documentation supporting FTA's funding recommendations for the two Core Capacity projects with grant agreements as of June 2017, and interviewed FTA officials and the six project sponsors. What GAO Found The Federal Transit Administration (FTA) has not addressed three of four outstanding statutory provisions concerning the Capital Investment Grants program. Three of these provisions stem from the MAP-21 and the FAST Act, which were enacted in 2012. When GAO initiated its review, FTA officials told GAO that FTA did not have immediate plans to address the outstanding provisions due to the administration's stated intent to phase out the program. FTA officials told GAO that other factors have also influenced FTA's decisions. For example, FTA officials noted that since GAO's last report, issuing regulations regarding the evaluation and rating process for Core Capacity projects was not identified as one of the Department of Transportation's regulatory priorities and, currently, FTA has no plans to issue such regulations. However, issuing regulations to address this provision is important. FTA officials told GAO that other factors have also influenced FTA's decisions.

    "gao_GAO-19-225T": "Why GAO Did This Study The Navy and Marine Corps have experienced significant mishaps at sea in recent years, resulting in 17 sailors' deaths and serious damage to Navy ships. The Navy and Marine Corps have made progress identifying the causes of their readiness decline and have begun efforts to arrest and reverse it; however, GAO's prior work shows that fully addressing the persistent readiness challenges will require years of sustained management attention. This testimony addresses (1) the Navy's and Marine Corps' readiness challenges and the costs associated with expanding the fleet to enhance readiness in the future, and (2) the extent to which the Navy and Marine Corps have sustained maintenance and supply challenges that affect readiness recovery. This statement is based on GAO's prior work and updated information from November 2018 on Navy and Marine Corps readiness. GAO's work has included a review of Navy and Marine Corps data on maintenance and supply challenges, and interviews with Navy and Marine Corps officials in Japan. What GAO Found The Navy and Marine Corps face significant challenges in rebuilding the readiness of their forces and the costs associated with expanding the fleet to enhance readiness in the future are unknown. The Navy has taken steps to address training shortfalls in the surface fleet, such as establishing controls to limit waivers that allowed training lapses to worsen, and the Navy has improved markedly in the percentage of cruisers and destroyers with lapsed certifications in Japan. However, the Navy continues to struggle with rebuilding the readiness of the existing fleet due to enduring maintenance and manning challenges. As the Navy seeks to expand its fleet by 25 percent, these challenges will likely be further exacerbated and the Navy will likely face additional affordability challenges. Navy and Marine Corps aircraft availability has been limited by aging aircraft, delayed maintenance, and insufficient supply support. Pilot and maintenance personnel shortfalls further limit readiness recovery across legacy air platforms. The growing F-35 program, which is meant to replace many aging aircraft, has presented additional operational and sustainment challenges, which will likely persist into the future if not corrected. DOD, the Navy, and the Marine Corps have emphasized mission capability of critical aviation platforms\u2014including the Navy and Marine Corps F/A-18s and F-35s\u2014and are taking steps to improve availability, but these efforts will take time to realize results.",
    "gao_GAO-18-268": "Why GAO Did This Study CBP has a long-term plan to improve operations at all U.S. ports of entry (POE), and in fiscal year 2017, CBP estimated that it needed approximately $5 billion to meet infrastructure and technology requirements at about 167 land POEs. In addition, CBP has entered into public-private partnerships with private sector and government entities to help meet the demand for CBP services and infrastructure improvements at POEs. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2014, included a provision for GAO to review CBP's RSP and DAP programs. This report examines (1) how CBP evaluates and administers its RSP and DAP programs and (2) the extent to which CBP monitors and evaluates the implementation and benefits of its RSP and DAP programs. GAO reviewed relevant legislation, CBP guidance, and CBP policies and procedures; analyzed data from CBP's overtime management system and partner payments; and interviewed CBP and partner officials. What GAO Found U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) uses criteria and documented procedures to evaluate and approve public-private partnership applications and administer programs. CBP's application process is streamlined and expanded in part because new legislative authorities removed previous restrictions on the number of RSP agreements CBP can enter into each year. CBP also uses criteria and documented processes to evaluate DAP proposals and implement the program. CBP and its partners have flexibility to tailor RSP implementation based on local conditions or needs. For example, CBP's partner at Miami International Airport relies on CBP to schedule RSP overtime daily based on CBP expertise. CBP and its partners also noted some challenges to implementing RSP and DAP agreements, but partners generally agreed that the program benefits outweighed the challenges. For example, some DAP partners GAO met with mentioned that navigating the General Services Administration's (GSA) approvals process was difficult and sometimes caused delays. CBP and its partners also noted some challenges to implementing RSP and DAP agreements, but partners generally agreed that the program benefits outweighed the challenges.

GAO was asked to review PLCY's efforts to lead, conduct, and coordinate departmentwide and crosscutting policy. This report examines (1) PLCY's efforts to lead, conduct, and coordinate departmentwide and crosscutting policy, and (2) PLCY's workforce needs and strategies to address them. GAO reviewed relevant laws, regulations, and guidance; analyzed PLCY documents; and interviewed PLCY officials and officials from 8 operational components, selected to reflect a range of missions and functions. What GAO Found The Department of Homeland Security's (DHS) Office of Policy (PLCY) has effectively carried out key coordination functions at the senior level related to strategy, but ambiguous roles and responsibilities have limited PLCY's ability to lead and coordinate policy. PLCY's efforts to lead and coordinate departmentwide and crosscutting policy have been effective in providing opportunities for all relevant stakeholders to learn about and contribute to departmentwide or crosscutting strategy development. However, PLCY's ability to lead and coordinate policy has been limited due to ambiguous roles and responsibilities and a lack of predictable, accountable, and repeatable procedures. PLCY officials acknowledged that this practice does not always make them the lead and there are no established criteria that define the circumstances under which PLCY (or another organizational unit) should lead development of policies that cut across organizational boundaries. PLCY officials stated that a separate, clear delegation of authority\u2014a mechanism by which the Secretary delegates responsibilities to other organizational units within DHS\u2014is needed to help confront the ambiguous roles it has experienced in the past. PLCY officials stated that past efforts to finalize a delegation of authority have stalled during leadership changes and that the initiative has been a lower priority, in part, due to where PLCY is in its maturation process and DHS is in its evolution into a more cohesive department under the Unity of Effort. As of May 2018, the effort had been revived, but it is not clear whether and when DHS will finalize it. PLCY",

In 2014, Medicaid spent about $80.6 billion on long-term care services, including assisted living facilities, in all settings. GAO was asked to review the oversight of Medicaid beneficiaries receiving assisted living services. This report examines (1) the extent to which states spent $10 billion on assisted living services in 2014, (2) how state Medicaid agencies oversee the health and welfare of beneficiaries receiving these services, and (3) steps CMS has taken to improve oversight of beneficiary health and welfare. GAO analyzed Medicaid data from the 48 states that reported spending $10 billion on assisted living services in 2014, surveyed state Medicaid agencies, and interviewed CMS officials. What GAO Found Forty-eight state Medicaid agencies reported collectively spending about $10 billion in state and federal Medicaid funds for assisted living services in 2014, according to GAO's survey. The other 3 states reported that they did not pay for assisted living services. GAO estimates that this spending for services provided by assisted living facilities represents 12.4 percent of the $80.6 billion Medicaid spent on long-term care services in all settings that year.

State Medicaid agencies varied in their approaches for overseeing the health and welfare of beneficiaries receiving assisted living services. Thirteen of the 48 states reported delegating administrative responsibilities, including oversight of beneficiary health and welfare, to other state or local agencies. The other 13 states reported that they did not review all information sources reviewed by other agencies. For their largest programs that covered assisted living services, the 48 states varied in their ability to report the number of critical incidents, how they defined incidents, and the extent to which they made information on such incidents readily available to the public. These states varied in whether they could provide GAO the number of critical incidents involving beneficiaries for their largest programs covering assisted living services, and for those that could report, the number of incidents they reported varied widely. In 26 of the 48 states the Medicaid agencies were unable to report, for their largest program covering assisted living services, the number of critical incidents",
    "gao_GAO-18-245": "Why GAO Did This Study The federal banking regulators have identified the risk associated with the growth in concentrations of CRE loans at community banks. GAO was asked to review the risk associated with CRE lending. This report examines (1) trends in the commercial real estate (CRE) lending markets, including changes in the level of credit and concentration risk in the markets, and (2) actions federal banking regulators took through their examinations to help ensure that banks with CRE concentrations are effectively managing the related risks. GAO reviewed academic literature and prior GAO work and interviewed officials from the federal banking regulators and private data providers. GAO also reviewed a nongeneralizable sample of 54 examinations conducted from 2013 through 2016, selected based on bank size and geographic distribution. GAO also reviewed relevant federal banking regulators' policies and procedures and interviewed officials from FDIC, the Federal Reserve, and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC). What GAO Found GAO found that credit and other risks related to bank CRE lending have increased over the past several years. Specifically, the number of banks with concentrated portfolios in CRE loans has increased from about 5,900 in 2007 to about 5,900 in 2017. Similarly, the number of banks with concentrated portfolios in CRE loans has also increased since 2014, from about 1,100 in 2007 to about 1,300 in 2016. GAO found that regulators generally subjected banks with relatively high concentrations in CRE loans to greater supervisory scrutiny in comparison to banks with relatively lower concentrations in CRE loans in GAO's review of 54 examinations for 40 banks conducted from 2013 through 2016. In all of these examinations, the regulators specifically assessed whether each bank had adequate risk management practices and capital for managing its CRE concentration risk and generally found that the banks had adequate risk management practices and capital. In a few examinations, regulators differed in how they addressed supervisory concerns about a bank's CRE-related risk management practices. For example, examiners generally did not use the CLD or total CRE concentration thresholds as limits on bank CRE lending. In the 41 examinations GAO reviewed, examiners assessed the banks' CRE-related risk management practices in both examinations. In the other 10 examinations, examiners did not mention in the report of examination the banks' practices for managing the risk associated with their CRE loans. In",
    "gao_GAO-19-180": "Why GAO Did This Study FATCA was enacted in 2010 to improve visibility into taxable income from foreign sources and enhance IRS's ability to identify and pursue taxpayer noncompliance. FATCA also promotes third-party reporting of foreign financial assets by requiring withholding agents to withhold 30 percent on certain payments to an FFI unless the FFI or the jurisdiction in which the FFI is located has entered into an agreement with the United States to report certain account information of their U.S. customers. GAO was asked to review FATCA implementation. This report (1) assesses IRS's efforts to use information collected under FATCA to improve taxpayer compliance; (2) examines available foreign financial asset reports submitted by U.S. persons, including submissions that were below required filing thresholds; (3) examines the extent to which the Department of the Treasury administers overlapping reporting requirements on foreign financial assets; (4) describes similarities and differences between FATCA and Common Reporting Standard (CRS) reporting requirements; and (5) examines the effects of FATCA implementation that are unique to U.S. persons living abroad. GAO reviewed IRS and FinCEN documents and interviewed IRS and FinCEN officials in headquarters and five countries selected to reflect a range of FATCA implementation experiences. What GAO Found The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) has limited efforts to increase compliance with the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (FATCA) reporting requirements because of data limitations and a lack of a comprehensive strategy. IRS requires taxpayers to identify their tax identification numbers (TIN) on Forms 8938 they submit. However, IRS could not link account information collected from FFIs to the account's owner because of incorrect or missing TINs. IRS officials said that IRS has taken steps to address missing TINs, but it has not yet done so. IRS also lacks complete and readily available information on foreign financial assets reported by individual filers on Forms 8938. IRS officials said they are waiting until they have a full set of data, including TINs, before doing analysis to develop a compliance strategy. IRS has stopped following its FATCA Compliance Roadmap, which IRS developed in 2016, because IRS moved away from updating broad strategy documents to focus on individual compliance campaigns.

The Secret Service is authorized to provide protection for spouses of major presidential and vice presidential candidates within 120 days of the general presidential election. GAO was asked to review the Secret Service's 2016 presidential campaign travel expenses and payment of those expenses. This report addresses the Secret Service's 2016 presidential campaign travel expenses and payment of those expenses. GAO analyzed Secret Service data on travel expenses for the 12 individuals protected during the 2016 presidential campaign and the 2016 presidential campaign as a whole. GAO also reviewed relevant federal laws, regulations, and policies. GAO also interviewed Secret Service officials and reviewed a generalizable stratified random sample of 650 flight segments from November 1, 2015 through the end of the 2016 presidential campaign. What GAO Found The U.S. Secret Service's (Secret Service) 2016 presidential campaign travel expenses totaled approximately $58 million, including $17.1 million in reimbursements to the campaign committees for 2,548 charter aircraft flights. The Secret Service's travel expenses for the 12 individuals protected during the 2016 presidential campaign totaled approximately $58 million, including $17.1 million in reimbursements to the campaign committees for 2,548 charter aircraft flights. The Secret Service's travel expenses for the 12 individuals protected during the 2016 presidential campaign totaled approximately $58 million, including $17.1 million in reimbursements to the campaign committees for 2,548 charter aircraft flights. The Secret Service did not always follow its travel policies, resulting in overpayments of at least an estimated $3.9 million. Specifically, the Secret Service did not follow its policies for determining the amount to reimburse the campaign committees for special agents' travel on chartered aircraft. Specifically, the Secret Service's policy for determining the amount to reimburse has been used since at least 1977. In August 2015, the Secret Service's Office of the Chief Counsel determined that the agency's reimbursement policy was inconsistent with the agency's directive on policy revisions. As a result, the Secret Service ceased to adhere to its longstanding reimbursement policy and agency officials were directed to use the pro rata calculation method for reimbursing all campaigns for agent airfares. Consequently, the Secret Service did not conduct the comparison between first-class and pro rata fares during the 2016 presidential campaign. Instead, the Secret Service paid the pro rata fare to",

OPM provides guidance and resources to agencies on performance management. GAO was asked to review OPM's guidance and resources. This report (1) describes federal employee perceptions of performance management as measured by the results of selected statements from OPM's annual FEVS; (2) identifies practices that selected agencies use to develop and implement strategies to improve performance management; and (3) evaluates OPM's guidance and resources to support agency efforts to improve performance management government-wide. GAO analyzed FEVS data from 2010 through 2017, reviewed OPM guidance and resources, and interviewed OPM officials. What GAO Found From 2010 through 2017, surveyed employees generally demonstrated positive responses to the Office of Personnel Management's (OPM) Federal Employment Viewpoint Survey (FEVS) statements related to four of OPM's five performance management phases, including: (1) planning and setting expectations; (2) continually monitoring performance; (3) developing the capacity to perform; (4) rating periodically to summarize performance; and (5) rewarding good performance. Employees had the lowest levels of agreement with statements related to rewarding performance (or an estimated 39 percent positive response). GAO also found that, across the selected statements, many of the largest gaps between supervisors and other employees were related to rewarding performance. Specifically, the responses to the statement, \u201cPromotions in my work unit are based on merit,\u201d varied the most based upon the supervisory status of the employee. GAO also found that selected agencies demonstrated some similar practices that may have been a contributing factor in having relatively high scores on FEVS performance management related statements. Specifically, employees at the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA), and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) consistently agreed or strongly agreed to selected FEVS statements related to the five phases of OPM's performance management cycle. While these agencies developed different performance management systems to reflect their specific structures and priorities, GAO found a number of practices common to all four agencies that are intended to help reinforce effective employee performance management and improve agency performance. All four agencies agreed that these practices helped contribute to their employees' responses to the selected FEVS statements and improved performance management.

DOD has established a solid training regimen and established minimum training, experience, and education requirements for people to manage acquisitions of various dollar thresholds. The services have also established repositories that share lessons learned and provide on-the-job learning opportunities to supplement the formal training. Yet, when compared to leading practices, GAO found that several practices used by the military services for training, mentoring, retaining, and selecting program managers could be improved. GAO analyzed DOD, military service, and relevant sub-component documentation on training, mentoring, retaining, and selecting program managers, including policies, guidance, strategic plans, curricula, online portals, and acquisition workforce data. GAO also interviewed DOD, military service, and relevant sub-component documentation on training, mentoring, retaining, and selecting program managers. What GAO Found GAO identified 10 practices, across four distinct areas, used by leading organizations to develop program manager talent based on its extensive review of Project Management Institute documents and discussions with AstraZeneca, Boeing, DXC Technology, and Rio Tinto. These four areas correspond to the internal control standards discussed previously. Program managers at these companies share similar basic responsibilities with DOD program managers, including overseeing the development and production of goods and services in a timely and cost-effective manner. Leading organizations provide a mix of formal and informal training opportunities focused on sharing knowledge and providing experiences that prepare people for program management, offer mentoring opportunities to guide people along career paths use a mix of financial and nonfinancial incentives to retain high select program managers based on identification of high-potential talent and then assign program managers based on program needs. Boeing representatives noted that by using a combination of these practices, over the past 15 years, their program managers have primarily left positions due to promotion or retirement. Rio Tinto representatives noted that in a challenging environment for finding suitable external talent, they have been able to use these practices to successfully develop most of the talent they need internally. DXC Technology representatives noted that these practices enabled their program managers to receive better feedback and address skill gaps. AstraZeneca representatives noted that these practices have made it easier for people to get the range of experiences they need to move into leadership positions.

The program allows parties to challenge patents that are invalid or unpatentable on a number of grounds, including subject matter eligibility, novelty, non-obviousness, and clarity and specificity. This testimony discusses (1) the extent to which patents challenged under the CBM program have been challenged and the extent to which the board has reviewed the patents and the processes that lead to them, and (2) stakeholders' views on the program's effects on innovation and investment. This statement is based on GAO's March 2018 report, Patent Trial and Appeal Board: Stakeholders Agree the CBM Program Has Reduced Litigation and Many See Value in Maintaining Aspects of the Program (GAO-2018-02-28). GAO reviewed relevant laws, regulations, and guidance; analyzed petition data from September 2012 through September 2017; and interviewed stakeholders, including patent owners, patent attorneys, and patent trial and appeal board judges. What GAO Found GAO found in its March 2018 report that, from September 2012 through September 2017, parties accused of patent infringement filed 524 petitions with the Patent Trial and Appeal Board challenging the validity of 359 distinct patents under the CBM program, resulting in rulings against about one-third of these patents. The average monthly number of CBM petitions fluctuated during this period and tapered off over time. Specifically, during this 5-year period, an average of more than 9 petitions per month were filed under the CBM program, but this average rate declined to fewer than 5 per month in the last fiscal year, with no petitions filed in August or September 2017. Stakeholders GAO interviewed suggested several possible reasons for the decline in CBM petitions, including recent decisions from the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit and U.S. Supreme Court that clarified which patents are eligible for CBM review; that CBM petitioners successfully targeted the lowest-quality business method patents\u2014 patents that should not have been issued because they did not meet the patentability requirements\u2014in the early years of the program, and now those patents have been eliminated; and that owners of business method patents are more war",

This report examines (1) the extent to which selected agencies met organizational placement criteria and (2) challenges facing FPS. GAO reviewed relevant legislation and DHS policies and interviewed officials from DHS, NPPD, and GSA. GAO also reviewed relevant federal laws and regulations and interviewed officials from selected agencies. What GAO Found GAO found that none of the selected agencies met all the organizational placement criteria for the Federal Protective Service (FPS), which is responsible for protecting federal facilities and providing law enforcement services. For example, none of the selected agencies met all the criteria for the mission, goals, and objectives criterion, and thus, any of the organizational placement options could result in both benefits and trade-offs.

The Bureau has a longstanding challenge of enumerating hard-to-count groups, such as minorities, young children, and renters. The Bureau has also been working to improve the enumeration of these groups in the 2020 Census. GAO was asked to review the Bureau's efforts to improve the enumeration of these groups. This report examines (1) the Bureau's plans to enhance its efforts to improve the enumeration of hard-to-count groups in the 2020 Census, and (2) the Bureau's internal management and external workforce challenges in improving the enumeration of these groups. GAO reviewed Bureau planning documents and interviewed Bureau officials. What GAO Found The Bureau plans to enhance its efforts to improve the enumeration of hard-to-count groups in the 2020 Census, but its estimated spending is similar to what it reported spending on those efforts in 2010 after adjusting for inflation. The Bureau plans to continue to rely on its Integrated Partnership and Communications operation\u2014designed to communicate the importance of census participation and motivate self-response\u2014as a key component of its efforts to improve the enumeration of hard-to-count persons in the 2020 Census. Evaluations conducted by the Bureau found that its partnership and communications efforts had positive effects on increasing awareness and participation among the hard-to-count in prior censuses. The Bureau also plans to change other key operations to help improve the enumeration of certain hard-to-count groups. For example, the Bureau overhauled a metric it has used to help manage and target field work for its partnerships to areas with hard-to-count populations, basing it now on predictions of each household's likelihood to self-respond to the census. The Bureau also plans to increase the number of non-English languages formally supported by the Bureau.

This testimony is based on GAO's October 2017 report, Medicare Part D: CMS Delegates Monitoring of Beneficiaries who Receive Opioid Prescriptions to Plan Sponsors, but Does Not Have Sufficient Information on Those Most At Risk for Harm (GAO-17-92). This statement is based on GAO's October 2017 report, Medicare Part D: CMS Delegates Monitoring of Beneficiaries who Receive Opioid Prescriptions to Plan Sponsors, but Does Not Have Sufficient Information on Those Most At Risk for Harm (GAO-17-92). GAO reviewed CMS guidance and data on beneficiaries who received opioids, and interviewed CMS officials. What GAO Found The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) delegates monitoring of beneficiaries who receive opioids to plan sponsors, but does not have sufficient information on those most at risk for harm. CMS guidance requires plan sponsors to implement a retrospective drug utilization review system to monitor beneficiary utilization starting in 2013. CMS also created the Overutilization Monitoring System (OMS), which outlines criteria to identify beneficiaries with high-risk use of opioids and to oversee sponsors' compliance with CMS's opioid overutilization policy. CMS reported a 61 percent decrease from calendar years 2011 through 2016 in the number of beneficiaries meeting the OMS criteria of high risk\u2014from 29,404 to 11,594 beneficiaries\u2014which agency officials consider an indication of success toward its goal of decreasing opioid use disorder. CMS also does not have comparable information on most beneficiaries who receive high doses of opioids\u2014regardless of the number of providers and pharmacies used\u2014and who therefore may be at risk for harm, according to CDC guidelines. These guidelines note that long-term use of high doses of opioids\u2014those above a MED of 90 mg per day\u2014are associated with significant risk of harm and should be avoided if possible.

This testimony discusses (1) how agencies decide whether to issue regulations or guidance and (2) the extent to which they adhere to OMB requirements and internal controls when developing guidance. This testimony is based on GAO's 2015 report on guidance processes at USDA, Education, HHS, and DOL, and selected subagencies that were selected based on their regulatory compliance with OMB requirements and internal controls. GAO reviewed relevant laws, regulations, and guidance documents and interviewed agency officials. GAO also reviewed relevant federal laws and regulations and interviewed agency officials. What GAO Found Agencies can better ensure effectiveness of guidance through consistent adherence to Office of Management and Budget (OMB) requirements and internal controls. Agencies considered a number of factors before deciding whether to issue guidance or undertake rulemaking. Among these factors, a key criterion was whether officials intended for the document to be binding (in which case they issued a regulation). OMB's Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs concurred that agencies understood what types of direction to regulated entities must go through the regulatory process. Officials from all four agencies also told GAO that they understood when guidance was inappropriate and when regulation was necessary. The agencies used guidance for multiple purposes and differed in the amount of guidance they issued. The purposes of guidance included explaining or interpreting regulations, clarifying policies in response to questions or compliance findings, disseminating suggested practices or leadership priorities, and providing grant administration information. Agencies also varied in the amount of guidance they issued, ranging from 10 to more than 100 documents issued in a single year. GAO found opportunities for agencies to improve regulatory guidance processes by strengthening compliance with OMB requirements for significant guidance and the use of management controls for producing their guidance documents. In 2015, GAO made 11 recommendations to USDA, HHS, DOL and Education to better ensure the adherence to OMB requirements for approval and public access of regulatory guidance, to strengthen the use of internal controls in guidance processes, and to improve the usability of websites with online guidance, three of which remain open. These recommendations for HHS remain open as well as an additional recommendation concerning developing written procedures for agency approval of written guidance.

These elements are, in part, intended to ensure beneficiaries' access to care under the TRICARE Select option, and they require DOD to ensure that at least 85 percent of the beneficiary population under TRICARE Select is covered by the network by January 1, 2018. The NDAA 2017 also required DOD to develop an implementation plan for TRICARE Select that includes seven specific elements. These elements are, in part, intended to ensure beneficiaries' access to care under the TRICARE Select option, and they require DOD to ensure that at least 85 percent of the beneficiary population under TRICARE Select is covered by the network by January 1, 2018. DOD's implementation plan for TRICARE Select included the seven elements mandated by the NDAA 2017. GAO reviewed DOD's implementation plan and interviewed DOD officials. What GAO Found The Department of Defense's (DOD) implementation plan for TRICARE Select included the seven elements mandated by the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2017 and addressed most of the leading planning practices for strategic management planning as identified by GAO's prior work. DOD's implementation plan described the upcoming changes to the TRICARE program and included individual sections outlining DOD's approach for implementing each of the required elements. For example, for element A\u2014ensure that at least 85 percent of the beneficiary population under TRICARE Select is covered by the network by January 1, 2018,\u2014DOD described, among other things, how the regional contractors will identify geographic areas with concentrations of TRICARE Select beneficiaries and how they will establish a sufficient provider network to serve that population. GAO also found that the implementation plan reflected most of the leading practices for strategic management planning as identified by GAO's prior work. For example, DOD's implementation plan clearly articulated a mission statement, which is \"to ensure beneficiaries receive the right level of care, at the right time, delivered",
    "gao_GAO-18-506T": "Why GAO Did This Study In fiscal year 2016, DHS and HHS provided about $1.3 billion in assistance to unaccompanied children. In fiscal year 2016, these children were estimated to have a total of about 5.5 million children. In fiscal year 2016, DHS and HHS removed about 63 percent of these children from El Salvador, Guatemala, or Honduras. This testimony is based on GAO's 2016 report, Unaccompanied Children: DHS and HHS Have Made Progress in Providing Care and Placement Services (GAO-16-32). This testimony is based on prior GAO reports issued from January 7, 2014, through April 17, 2015, and selected updates conducted in April 2018. GAO reviewed relevant laws, regulations, and guidance; interviewed agency officials; and reviewed relevant federal laws, regulations, and guidance. What GAO Found In response to a recommendation in GAO's 2016 report, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) have agreed to establish a joint collaborative process for the referral and transfer of unaccompanied children from DHS to ORR shelters, but the process has not yet been implemented. It will be important to ensure that, once implemented, this process has clearly defined roles and responsibilities for each agency, as GAO recommended. In response to a recommendation in GAO's 2016 report, DHS and HHS have agreed to establish a joint collaborative process for the referral and transfer of unaccompanied children from DHS to ORR shelters, but the process has not yet been implemented. It will be important to ensure that, once implemented, this process has clearly defined roles and responsibilities for each agency, as GAO recommended. In response to a recommendation in GAO's 2016 report, ORR reported taking steps to improve monitoring of its grantees, including reviewing its monitoring protocols and ensuring all grantees were monitored over a 2-year period. These steps should increase the timeliness, completeness, and consistency of ORR's monitoring; however, ORR needs to ensure that its updated processes and protocols are fully implemented and in use. In 2016, GAO reported that ORR relies on grantees to provide care for unaccompanied children, such as housing and educational, medical, and therapeutic services, and to document in children's case files the services they provide.

    "gao_GAO-18-326": "Why GAO Did This Study DOD has a history of acquiring major information systems (MAIS) that are intended to support military operations and support other critical operations. The National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2012 mandated that GAO select, assess, and report on selected MAIS programs annually through March 2018. The act also required GAO to report on the extent to which MAIS programs have used leading information technology (IT) acquisition practices, including requirements and risk management. This report (1) assesses DOD's policy for the management and oversight of MAIS programs; (2) describes the extent to which selected MAIS programs have changed their planned cost and schedule estimates and met performance targets; and (3) assesses the extent to which selected MAIS programs have used leading information technology (IT) acquisition practices, including requirements and risk management. GAO analyzed DOD's policy for MAIS programs and MAIS business programs and compared it to leading IT management practices. GAO also interviewed officials from DOD and selected MAIS programs. What GAO Found The Department of Defense's (DOD) policy for the management and oversight of MAIS programs does not always adhere to leading IT management practices. For example, while the policy for non-business MAIS programs is consistent in its adherence to all four of the leading IT management practices, the policy for MAIS business programs is consistent in its adherence to only two of the four practices. Specifically, the policy for MAIS business programs does not adhere to two of the leading practices on establishing initial and current baseline estimates on cost and schedule and predetermining threshold estimates, as well as reporting periodically on performance information to stakeholders. Until DOD updates its policy for MAIS business programs to adhere to leading practices on the establishment of baseline estimates on cost and schedule to include threshold estimates on cost and schedule to identify when programs may be at high risk, stakeholders may not have the information they need to manage and oversee MAIS business programs.

    "gao_GAO-19-214": "Why GAO Did This Study DOD is responsible for acquiring defense items and services for foreign customers through the FMS program. Foreign customers may request price and availability data to inform their acquisition strategy, obtain a sense of affordability, and budget planning. GAO was asked to review DOD's FMS price and availability process. This report (1) describes foreign military sales (FMS) price and availability requests DOD received from fiscal years 2014 through 2018, (2) assesses DOD's guidance on developing price and availability data, (3) describes how DOD develops price and availability data for the requested capability, and (4) identified factors that can influence the timeliness of DOD to provide price and availability data to the customer. GAO analyzed DOD's guidance and other data, reviewed five examples of price and availability data DOD received from fiscal year 2017, and interviewed DOD officials and contractors. What GAO Found From fiscal years 2014 through 2018, the Department of Defense (DOD) reported receiving 3,038 requests for price and availability data from foreign customers from 93 countries and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. Foreign customers requested services and items such as training and support services for weapon systems, missiles and ammunition, aircraft, and communication equipment. Foreign customers GAO obtained information from noted that there may be numerous reasons for why they might choose not to pursue a potential sale. For example, the item or service could not be made available within a timeframe to meet their needs; the overall capability was not affordable; or price and availability estimates were higher than estimates from other foreign sources. DOD's guidance allows for flexibility in developing price and availability data and reflect leading practices for using quality information. DOD's guidance reflects attributes conducive to using quality information as called for by federal internal control standards. For example, the standards call for agencies to define information requirements and obtain relevant data from reliable sources. DOD's guidance reflects this, stating that price and availability data should serve as rough order of magnitude estimates of the cost and availability of defense items or services and are for rough-order planning purposes. DOD officials told GAO that a flexible process is needed to account for various circumstances specific to each request. In selected examples, DOD included comprehensive data on ownership costs when developing price and availability responses. For example, in four of the five cases GAO reviewed, DOD officials included costs for training and support, which are not part of the initial request. DOD",
    "gao_GAO-18-550": "Why GAO Did This Study DHS has 14 components that are responsible for assessing capability needs, developing requirements, and creating acquisition programs to meet these needs. GAO was asked to review DHS's requirements development process. This report discusses (1) how often selected DHS programs changed requirements; and assesses the extent to which the selected components have (2) developed policies for requirements development, (3) established independent requirements organizations, and (4) taken steps to assess and train a requirements workforce. GAO reviewed DHS acquisition policies and acquisition program baselines and interviewed DHS officials. What GAO Found GAO found that 9 of 14 programs from the seven Department of Homeland Security (DHS) components that GAO reviewed changed requirements for various reasons after program approval and entry into the \"Obtain\" phase. DHS had initially approved most programs' key performance parameters before DHS reestablished its Joint Requirements Council (JRC) in November 2014. Whether these programs changed their requirements is unclear. The causes of these changes varied, but included requirements did not accurately describe end user needs, were not achievable given available technologies, or that programs pursued greater capability than originally intended. In the absence of component-level requirements policies, some sub-organizations and programs within the components have developed their own requirements policies. Three of the seven DHS components in GAO's review have established independent requirements development organizations, such as offices or directorates independent of the acquisition function. Among the reasons cited by these components' officials was recognition of the importance of the operational requirements development function for addressing capability gaps. Those that do not have separate requirements organizations cited, among other things, the smaller size of their components and the fewer number of major acquisitions. However, according to key principles, independent lines of authority should develop operational requirements and manage acquisitions separately, regardless of size. Two of the seven components GAO reviewed have assessed requirements workforce needs, and one has provided requirements specific training. Components gave different reasons why they have not yet taken one or more of these steps, including a lack of resources. Specifically, two components have assessed requirements workforce needs, and one has provided requirements specific training.",

NNSA has estimated that it will need about $1.4 billion in fiscal year 2018 to carry out its annual activities associated with the management of these programs. GAO was asked to review NNSA's strategic materials programs. This report examines (1) the extent to which NNSA has defined program requirements and established roles and responsibilities for program managers, and (2) the extent to which NNSA has implemented program requirements and established roles and responsibilities for program managers. GAO reviewed NNSA documents and interviewed agency officials. What GAO Found The National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA) has defined program requirements for its five strategic materials programs and established the roles and responsibilities of the programs' managers. NNSA defined these program requirements in two documents issued in 2016 and 2017. Collectively, these documents set documentation requirements as well as established the roles and responsibilities of the programs' managers. NNSA officials told GAO that they are making progress in implementing the program requirements outlined for each of the strategic materials programs, although some are further along than others. However, these officials said that relatively few staff had been assigned to these programs, which has challenged implementation efforts. For its two strategic materials programs established in 2014\u2014uranium and domestic uranium enrichment\u2014NNSA officials told GAO that they are generally meeting the program requirements outlined in the Program Execution Instruction and the Program Management Policy for Weapons and Strategic Materials. However, NNSA officials said that relatively few staff had been assigned to these programs, which has challenged implementation efforts. For example, the plutonium manager said more staff were needed to successfully implement the program, and the lithium lead point of contact said that at least two full-time staff members would be required to accomplish the work needed to make the lithium program meet program requirements. NNSA officials cited competing agency priorities and current perceived staffing limits as the primary impediments to assigning more staff to these programs. NNSA officials said that they have limited flexibility when it comes to increasing federal staff levels. Specifically, in each year that the total number of federal employees at NNSA exceeds 1,690, the Administrator is required by law to submit to the congressional defense committees a report justifying such excess.

FEMA's risk-based grant assessment model is used to identify which of the 100 most populous urban areas are eligible for grant awards in a particular fiscal year. GAO was asked to review FEMA's risk-based grant assessment model. This report examines (1) the factors that affected the allocation of SHSP and UASI grant funds to states and urban areas from fiscal years 2008 through 2018, and (2) the extent to which FEMA has assessed and improved its risk-based grant assessment model for allocating SHSP and UASI grants. GAO reviewed relevant laws, regulations, and FEMA documents; analyzed FEMA's risk-based grant assessment model from fiscal years 2008 through 2018, and interviewed DHS and FEMA officials; and analyzed FEMA's risk-based grant assessment model for fiscal years 2008 through 2018. What GAO Found The Department of Homeland Security's (DHS) State Homeland Security Grant Program (SHSP) and Urban Area Security Initiative (UASI) grant programs have generally declined over the period of fiscal years 2008 through 2018, but have remained consistent since fiscal year 2016. For example, annual funding for SHSP decreased from about $861 million in fiscal year 2008, to $402 million in fiscal year 2018. During this same period, annual funding for UASI also declined, from about $782 million in fiscal year 2008 to $580 million in fiscal year 2018. However, annual funding for the UASI program has been higher than the SHSP program since fiscal year 2010. For fiscal year 2018, the total SHSP funds awarded to states and territories based on FEMA's risk-based grant assessment model was 55 percent\u2014about $220 million of $402 million. The UASI program uses FEMA's risk-based grant assessment model to identify which of the 100 most populous metropolitan statistical areas are eligible for grant awards in a particular fiscal year. Then, FEMA's risk model also helps inform DHS leadership's decisions on the final funding amounts for each grantee, according to FEMA officials. Since 2008, FEMA has taken a number of steps to assess and improve its risk-based grant assessment model for allocating grants based on past reviews, GAO's prior recommendations, and various changes related to evolving terrorist threats and real",

The act also requires DHS to assess its cybersecurity workforce. This testimony is based on GAO's ongoing work on DHS's cybersecurity efforts. It addresses the extent to which DHS (1) has implemented its cybersecurity authorities and responsibilities, (2) has taken actions to identify its cybersecurity workforce, and (3) has taken actions to identify its cybersecurity critical needs. GAO reviewed relevant federal laws and policies, and interviewed DHS officials. What GAO Found The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has broad authorities to improve and promote cybersecurity of federal and private-sector networks. The federal laws and policies that underpin these authorities include the Federal Information Security Modernization Act of 2014, which clarified and expanded DHS's responsibilities for assisting with the implementation of, and overseeing, information security at federal agencies. These responsibilities include requirements to: develop, issue, and oversee agencies' implementation of binding operational directives to agencies, including directives for incident reporting, contents of annual agency reports, and other operational requirements; monitor agencies' implementation of information security policies provide operational and technical assistance to agencies, including by operating the federal information security incident center, deploying technology to continuously diagnose and mitigate threats, and conducting threat and vulnerability assessments of systems.

    "gao_GAO-18-22": "Why GAO Did This Study Agencies are required by statute and Executive requirements to consider alternative ways of regulating and preferred regulatory designs, such as performance standards rather than means-based design standards. GAO was asked to review how agencies make key decisions related to regulatory design, compliance and enforcement, and updating of regulations. This report describes how selected agencies report (1) making decisions on regulatory designs among available options, (2) making decisions to designate resources among available compliance and enforcement activities, and (3) evaluating those decisions, and also identifies (4) key considerations for decision makers related to regulatory design and enforcement. GAO reviewed relevant laws, executive orders, and other documents and interviewed agency officials. GAO also reviewed relevant academic and practitioner research and interviewed subject matter specialists. What GAO Found When agencies determine that they may need to regulate, they generally have multiple regulatory designs available to achieve their objectives. Agencies are directed by statute and Executive requirements to assess alternatives to regulatory action\u2014including not issuing new regulations\u2014and different ways of regulating. Available regulatory designs range from prescriptive regulations that specify the adoption of a certain technology or action to designs that generally provide regulated entities with more discretion and options for compliance, and in some instances hybrid designs that incorporate both prescriptive and less prescriptive elements. Agencies also reported that their regulatory objectives sometimes required a prescriptive regulation or that in some instances regulated entities expressed a preference for prescriptiveness. For example, the Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA) determined that requiring more frequent respirable dust sampling for mining occupations known to have high dust levels and requiring the use of certain monitoring devices to measure respirable coal dust exposure are necessary to limit exposure to respirable coal mine dust and thus reduce occupational lung diseases. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) have both implemented voluntary programs to promote the adoption of practices among regulated entities that align with the agencies' regulatory objectives. When regulations are promulgated, agency officials must determine how they will promote compliance with their regulations and deter noncompliance. Agencies generally have the flexibility to tailor their compliance and enforcement strategies to encourage voluntary compliance and inform regulated entities of regulatory requirements. For example, OSHA conducts two types of inspections\u2014un-programmed and \"programmed\"\u2014to target resources for the 8 million workplaces it regulates.

TSARA, as enacted on December 18, 2014, includes a number of requirements for TSA, including developing and submitting a biennial technology investment plan and annual small business contracting goals reports to Congress. GAO was asked to review TSA's acquisition practices. This report examines, among other things, the extent to which TSA (1) addressed TSARA requirements and (2) reported SRT-related acquisitions to Congress pursuant to TSARA. GAO reviewed TSA's policies and procedures and interviewed TSA officials. What GAO Found The Transportation Security Acquisition Reform Act (TSARA) requires the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) to address TSARA requirements, including those related to acquisition justifications, baseline requirements, managing inventory, and consistency with regulations. Since 2016, TSA has generally addressed TSARA requirements through its acquisition policies and procedures. For example, TSA has developed and issued an updated technology investment plan. Further, TSA has continued to submit an annual report to Congress on TSA's performance record in meeting its published small business contracting goals. Through July 2018, TSA's narrow application of TSARA's report and certification provision resulted in no SRT acquisitions being reported to Congress pursuant to TSARA. In August 2018, TSA provided its first three notifications on SRT acquisitions to Congress under this provision. TSA officials said that none of the agency's acquisition activities from enactment through July 2018 invoked TSARA's report and certification provision because the activities did not align with TSA's policy that identifies SRT acquisitions subject to this provision. TSA officials explained that in accordance with its policy, TSA provided its first three notifications to Congress under TSARA's report and certification provision in August 2018, more than 30 days prior to the award of three new SRT contracts, each with ceiling values in excess of $30 million. TSA officials said that research and development advancements have allowed TSA to upgrade existing equipment that had reached the end of its initial lifecycle rather than acquire new equipment. Further, TSA will likely need to increase spending on maintenance services because the equipment parts may break down when used past their intended life cycles. TSA",

The federal government and states play important roles in reducing improper payments and overseeing the Medicaid program, including overseeing spending on Medicaid supplemental payments and demonstrations. This testimony discusses (1) the extent to which improper payments and supplemental payments pose risks to the fiscal integrity of Medicaid, and (2) fundamental actions needed to strengthen oversight and manage program risks. This statement is based on GAO's body of work on Medicaid fraud and improper payments, and selected updates conducted in May 2018. GAO reviewed relevant federal laws, regulations, and CMS documents; interviewed CMS officials; and conducted site visits to six states. What GAO Found GAO's prior work has identified three broad areas of risk to the fiscal integrity of Medicaid: improper payment rates, state use of supplemental payments, and oversight of demonstration programs. GAO's prior work has identified three broad areas of risk to the fiscal integrity of Medicaid: improper payment rates, state use of supplemental payments, and oversight of demonstration programs. GAO identified 10 federal and state audits and investigations (out of 27 focused on Medicaid managed care) that cited about $68 million in overpayments and unallowable managed care organization costs that were not accounted for by the managed care improper payment estimate. Another of these investigations resulted in a $137.5 million settlement to resolve allegations of false claims. GAO also noted that the full extent of overpayments and unallowable costs is unknown, because the 27 audits and investigations were conducted over more than 5 years and involved a small fraction of the more than 270 managed care organizations operating nationwide as of September 2017. GAO also noted that another effort to address program risks in managed care\u2014the use of CMS program integrity contractors to audit providers that are paid by managed care organizations\u2014has been limited. To address the program risks that are not measured as a part of CMS's methodology to estimate improper payments, in May 2018, GAO recommended that CMS take steps to mitigate such risks, including revising its methodology or focusing additional audit resources on managed care. HHS concurred with this recommendation. Supplemental payments are payments made to providers\u2014such as local government hospitals and other providers\u2014that are in addition to the regular, claims-based payments made to providers for services they provide.

Agencies may use the authority to replace property that no longer performs its function. GAO was asked to review the authority. This report (1) describes what is known about personal property exchange/sale transactions, as reported by federal agencies from fiscal years 2013 through 2017, and (2) examines selected agencies' experiences using the authority and monitoring such activities. GAO analyzed GSA's annual summary data on personal property exchange/sale transactions from fiscal years 2013 through 2017. GAO also interviewed officials from GSA, the Department of Defense (DOD), and VA. What GAO Found According to the General Services Administration's (GSA) annual summary data, 27 federal agencies reported using the personal property exchange/sale authority and received a total of about $3.1 billion in exchange allowances or sale proceeds from fiscal year 2013 through fiscal year 2017. While many agencies used the authority, a few agencies, particularly GSA, together accounted for about 90 percent of all allowances and proceeds. Specifically, 5 of 27 agencies reported nearly all exchange allowances and sale proceeds. GSA accounted for about $1.9 billion of about $3.1 billion (or about 60 percent) of reported allowances and proceeds across the federal government. Four other agencies\u2014the Departments of Homeland Security, Agriculture, Defense, and the Interior\u2014accounted for about $934 million (or about 30 percent) of the total. The other 22 agencies using the authority reported about $332 million (or about 11 percent) in exchange allowances or sales proceeds over the 5-year period. While some agencies reported hundreds of millions of dollars in exchange allowances and sale proceeds, the data show that 10 federal agencies\u2014including the Department of Labor, Office of Personnel Management, and the Social Security Administration\u2014reported relatively few transactions, which totaled less than $100,000 in exchange allowances and sale proceeds. GSA regulations for the personal property exchange/sale authority set forth several conditions for using the authority, including that the property exchanged or sold is not excess or surplus and that agencies report information on their exchange/sale transactions to GSA on an annual basis. However, the agencies in GAO's review had different levels of understanding about the authority, which affected their experiences for how they used the authority and outcomes. For example, VA officials said they misunderstood key aspects of the",

The Corps manages inland waterways construction projects, which are intended to replace, expand, and modernize locks and dams. The inland waterways are critical to the nation's freight transportation system, and the Corps must manage the system within the context of competing priorities and limited resources. GAO was asked to review the Corps' management of the inland waterways. This report (1) assesses how the Corps allocates funds for operations and maintenance projects for the inland waterways system; (2) describes how the Corps prioritizes and funds construction projects, and assesses the effect of the current-funding approach on projects' costs and schedules; and (3) presents stakeholder opinions on proposed options to alter the funding and management of inland waterways and any associated limitations or trade-offs. GAO analyzed Corps financial data on obligations for operations and maintenance for inland waterways navigation projects for fiscal years 2006 through 2017, and allocations for construction and major rehabilitation of locks and dams for fiscal years 1997 through 2018. GAO also interviewed Corps officials and stakeholders, and conducted a simulation of the effects of various funding approaches on total project costs and construction schedules. What GAO Found The Corps allocates funds for operations and maintenance projects on the 27 inland waterways subject to the inland waterways diesel fuel tax, but lacks a method of tracking deferred maintenance for inland waterways. The Corps develops an annual budget request for all its civil works activities, including locks and dams, and develops an annual budget request to submit to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB). The Corps identifies potential operations activities and maintenance projects and submits estimates of the costs to complete those activities, but not all identified maintenance projects are included in the budget request. The Corps also prioritizes inland waterways construction projects based on expected costs and benefits. However, the lack of a measure of deferred maintenance for inland waterways is inconsistent with federal internal-control standards, which call for agencies to identify information requirements needed to achieve objectives and address identified risks (such as reliability of the waterways) and to process relevant data to develop that information. As a result, the Corps is limited in its ability to identify preventive maintenance that could forestall",

The CHIP-IN Act also required that GAO review the CHIP-IN pilot program. This report examines (1) the extent to which VA has established a framework for effective pilot design and (2) the extent to which the CHIP-IN pilot can improve project implementation. GAO reviewed relevant federal laws, regulations, and guidance; interviewed VA officials and the Omaha donor group; and reviewed relevant federal standards for internal control. What GAO Found The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) has not yet established a framework for effective pilot design for the CHIP-IN pilot program. In 2016, GAO identified five leading practices for designing a well-developed and documented pilot program: articulating an assessment methodology, developing an evaluation plan, assessing scalability, and ensuring stakeholder communication.

The SAR, issued in December 2017, emphasized the need to integrate all instruments of the United States' national power in order to deter conflict and secure peace. GAO was asked to review U.S. efforts to address conflict abroad. This report (1) describes examples of U.S. agencies' and USIP's efforts to prevent and mitigate conflict and stabilize conflict-affected areas, and (2) examines the extent to which U.S. agencies and USIP incorporated key collaboration practices to coordinate their efforts. GAO reviewed agency documents and interviewed agency officials in Washington, D.C.; Iraq; Nigeria; and Syria. What GAO Found The Departments of State (State) and Defense (DOD), the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), and the U.S. Institute of Peace (USIP) reported that they have conducted a variety of efforts in Iraq, Nigeria, and Syria aimed at preventing and mitigating violent conflicts and stabilizing areas affected by such conflicts. In response to GAO's request, each agency and USIP provided descriptions and goals for their specific program-level or project-level efforts in Iraq, Nigeria, and Syria (and in neighboring countries for Syria). To identify these efforts, each agency and USIP used its own terminology and definitions that were in place in fiscal year 2017. For Iraq, State reported a list of three individual efforts and four categories of other efforts as active in fiscal year 2017. For Nigeria, State reported 21 efforts as active in fiscal year 2017. USAID reported five efforts as active in fiscal year 2017. For Syria, DOD reported eight efforts as active in fiscal year 2017. State, USAID, DOD, and USIP have incorporated aspects of key collaboration practices to coordinate their conflict prevention, mitigation, and stabilization efforts for Iraq, Nigeria, and Syria. However, the agencies have not documented their agreement on coordination for stabilization efforts in conflict-affected areas through formal written guidance and agreements that address key collaboration practices.

    "gao_GAO-18-16": "Why GAO Did This Study The Coast Guard is responsible for enforcing federal laws and regulations related to commercial fishing vessel safety. Congress has enacted legislation to improve vessel safety, including establishing classification requirements for all types of commercial fishing vessels. The Coast Guard Authorization Act of 2015 included a provision for GAO to review the safety of commercial fishing vessels. This report assesses (1) what is known about the numbers and rates of commercial fishing vessel accidents, injuries, and fatalities; (2) what is known about the costs to construct and maintain classed commercial fishing vessels built since July 2013 and the effects of classing on vessel builders and owners; (3) the benefits associated with classing commercial fishing vessels; and (4) how the alternative-to-class approach compares with building and maintaining commercial fishing vessels to classification society standards. GAO analyzed Coast Guard data on commercial fishing vessel accidents, injuries, and fatalities for 2006 through 2015, reviewed relevant laws and regulations, and interviewed Coast Guard officials and representatives from three classification societies\u2014American Bureau of Shipping, Det Norske Veritas Germanischer Lloyd, and RINA\u2014and vessel owners and/or operators. What GAO Found The Coast Guard investigated 2,101 commercial fishing vessel accidents between 2006 and 2015 that were identified as occurring in federal waters. While the number of accidents in 2015 was greater than the number reported in 2006, the number of injuries and fatalities declined over the same 10-year period. GAO could not assess the number of accidents, injuries, and fatalities by fishery due to limitations with the Coast Guard's data. In addition, GAO was unable to calculate the rates of commercial fishing vessel accidents, injuries, and fatalities because reliable data on certain information needed to do so\u2014including the total number of vessels that are actively fishing and the fishery or region in which the vessel operates\u2014are either not maintained or are not collected by the Coast Guard or other federal agencies. Without such information, Congress and the agencies will lack important data needed to accurately assess the factors that contribute to commercial fishing vessel accidents, injuries, and fatalities. While data on the costs of classing are limited, stakeholders GAO interviewed\u2014classification society representatives, vessel owners, and builders\u2014stated that constructing and maintaining classed commercial fishing vessels will increase ownership costs, due, in part, to the fees charged by classification societies, the requirement to use certified materials and equipment, and annual maintenance surveys, among other costs.

Lifeline is a federal program that provides telephone service to eligible beneficiaries. FCC and USAC administer the USF, which is administered by USAC. GAO has previously reported on program risks and oversight. This statement discusses (1) FCC's and USAC's actions to evaluate Lifeline's performance in meeting program goals, (2) FCC's and USAC's actions to improve subscriber eligibility verification, and (3) FCC's and USAC's actions to improve oversight of Lifeline providers. This statement is based on GAO's May 2017 report, Lifeline: FCC and USAC Have Taken Steps to Improve Oversight of Lifeline Providers (GAO-17-672) and May 2017 report, Lifeline: FCC and USAC Have Taken Steps to Improve Oversight of Lifeline Providers (GAO-17-672). GAO reviewed FCC and USAC documents and interviewed FCC and USAC officials. GAO also conducted 21 undercover tests of Lifeline providers and fictitious Lifeline applications. What GAO Found The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) has not evaluated Lifeline's performance in meeting program goals but, as GAO found in May 2017, has taken steps toward evaluation. FCC has not evaluated Lifeline's effectiveness in achieving its performance goals of ensuring the availability of voice service for low-income Americans, while minimizing the burden on those who contribute to the Unemployment Security Fund (USF). GAO recommended, and FCC agreed, to conduct a program evaluation to determine the extent to which Lifeline is efficiently and effectively reaching its performance goals. FCC has recently taken some steps toward evaluating Lifeline's performance in meeting program goals. For example, FCC instructed USAC to hire an outside, independent, third-party evaluator to complete a program evaluation of Lifeline's design, function, and administration. FCC generally agreed with GAO's recommendations. FCC and USAC have implemented controls to improve subscriber eligibility verification, such as implementing the National Lifeline Access Database in 2014, which helps carriers identify and resolve duplicate claims for Lifeline-supported services.

FRA oversees PTC implementation by requiring commuter railroads to install PTC equipment and train employees. This testimony addresses (1) commuter railroads' progress in implementing PTC; (2) how many, if any, commuter railroads may be at risk of not meeting the mandated PTC deadline or certain extension criteria, and what factors may be affecting implementation progress; and (3) the extent to which FRA's management and oversight approach has helped ensure that commuter railroads either meet the deadline or qualify for an extension. This statement is based on GAO's September 2015 report, Rail Safety Improvement Act of 2008, and applicable FRA regulations, reports, and guidance. GAO reviewed FRA's implementation progress reports and interviewed FRA officials and representatives from 19 commuter railroads selected based on their implementation status and geographic location. What GAO Found Most of the 29 commuter railroads that GAO reviewed have reported progress in some of the key areas of PTC implementation that FRA monitors, such as locomotive and wayside equipment installation. However, the amount of progress reported varies across individual railroads. Over half of the commuter railroads reported that they have made substantial progress in some initial implementation activities, while other railroads reported that they have made much more limited progress or have yet to begin equipment installation or employee training. For example, 18 commuter railroads reported 50 percent or more of their locomotive PTC equipment was installed, and of these, 13 had completed installation. In contrast, 6 railroads reported that they had not started installation of locomotive equipment. Similarly, 16 commuter railroads reported 50 percent or more of their wayside PTC equipment was installed, and half of them reported that they had completed installation. Moreover, 13 commuter railroads reported that they had made the most progress in obtaining spectrum, which allows PTC components to transmit information about a train's movements and location. Moreover, 13 commuter railroads reported that they planned to seek a deadline extension, and the remaining 16 said they do not intend to seek an extension.

HCBS is a key component of Medicaid, which provides services to individuals with physical, cognitive, or mental disabilities or conditions. GAO was asked to review the structure of HCBS programs in selected states. This report examines (1) the structure of selected states' HCBS programs and populations served, (2) the challenges selected states have faced providing HCBS, and (3) the extent to which selected states have taken steps to respond to these challenges. GAO reviewed relevant federal laws and regulations, and interviewed officials from CMS, five selected states, and four Medicaid managed care organizations (MCO) selected based on their size and geographic diversity. GAO also reviewed relevant federal laws and regulations and interviewed officials from CMS, five selected states, and four MCOs selected based on their size and geographic diversity. What GAO Found The structure of the 26 home- and community-based services (HCBS) programs GAO reviewed in selected states reflected decisions about which populations states wanted to cover, whether to limit eligibility for or enrollment in HCBS programs, and whether the state wanted to provide HCBS through managed care (i.e., managed care). Four of the five selected states\u2014Florida, Mississippi, Montana, and Oregon\u2014had multiple HCBS programs that targeted specific populations, such as individuals with intellectual or developmental disabilities. The fifth state, Arizona, used one program to provide HCBS to individuals who are aged or disabled and those with intellectual or developmental disabilities. The remaining four programs were not targeted to specific populations. The structure of the 26 HCBS programs GAO reviewed in selected states reflected decisions about which populations states wanted to cover, whether to limit eligibility for or enrollment in HCBS programs, and whether the state wanted to provide HCBS through managed care (i.e., MLTSS). In two states, settlements resulting from litigation also affected the structure of HCBS programs. Officials from the five selected states and MCOs GAO interviewed described challenges with providing HCBS, including workforce issues, such as recruiting and retaining direct care workers; serving beneficiaries with complex medical and behavioral health needs; and other challenges.

The PAC is also responsible for ensuring that the nation's government has the right information at the right time. The PAC is comprised of ODNI, OPM, and a cross-agency committee, which is chaired by the Director of National Intelligence. This testimony discusses the status of key reform initiatives and the extent to which the PAC has (1) made progress in reforming the personnel security clearance process and (2) developed a government-wide approach to help agencies improve the timeliness of initial personnel security clearances. This testimony is based on GAO's December 2017 report, titled ODNI: Progress in Reforming the Personnel Security Clearance Process and Developing Government-wide Performance Measures for the Quality of Investigations (GAO-17-282). GAO reviewed relevant laws, regulations, and guidance; analyzed agency-specific data; and interviewed officials from ODNI, OPM, and PAC. What GAO Found The PAC has made progress in reforming the personnel security clearance process and implementing various security clearance reform initiatives. For example, the PAC has taken action on 73 percent of the recommendations of a February 2014 review conducted in the wake of the Washington Navy Yard shooting. Actions in response to these recommendations included the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI) and the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) jointly issuing Quality Assessment Standards in January 2015, which establish federal guidelines for assessing the quality of investigations. Additionally, ODNI developed the Quality Assessment Reporting Tool, through which agencies will report on the completeness of investigations.

DEA established DCE/SP in 1981 to support participating state and local law enforcement agencies in their efforts to eradicate and suppress illegal, domestically-grown marijuana. GAO was asked to review DEA's DCE/SP program. This report examines (1) the amount of funding DEA obligated to DCE/SP from 2015 through fiscal year 2018, (2) the extent to which DEA oversees participating agencies' expenditure of DCE/SP funds, and (3) the extent to which DEA collects and uses information on DCE/SP activities to help manage the program. GAO reviewed DEA data on DCE/SP funds and expenditures from 2015 through fiscal year 2017, and interviewed DEA officials and officials from six states selected based on marijuana eradication and suppression efforts. What GAO Found The Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) obligated about $17.7 million annually on average to state and local law enforcement agencies (participating agencies) in 43 states and the U.S. Virgin Islands to support their marijuana eradication and suppression efforts. During each year of the 4-year time frame GAO reviewed, DEA obligated most of the DCE/SP funds to support the marijuana eradication efforts of the participating agencies\u2014for example, $14 million of the $18 million in fiscal year 2018 went to 125 participating agencies in 37 states, or approximately $378,000 on average per state. DEA obligated the remaining funds\u2014for example, $4 million in fiscal year 2018\u2014to pay for program support. DEA officials reported that they obligate funding to participating agencies based on various factors, including the agencies' past performance, their level of matching investment in the program, and the approximate amount of illegal growing in an area. DEA officials noted that some marijuana grows may still be illegal under state and local law\u2014even in those states that have legalized or regulated marijuana in some form under state or local law. DEA oversees participating agencies' expenditure of DCE/SP funds in various ways, but does not consistently collect supporting documentation from participating agencies regarding their reported expenditures.

In June 2017, GAO reported that EOIR could take several actions to address long-standing management and operational challenges and reduce the case backlog. This statement discusses (1) the extent to which experts and stakeholders have proposed restructuring the immigration court system and (2) EOIR's actions to improve its management of the immigration courts. This statement is based on GAO's June 2017 report, Immigration Courts: Actions Needed to Improve EOIR's Management of the Immigration Courts (GAO-17-322). GAO reviewed relevant laws, regulations, and guidance; interviewed officials from EOIR, the Department of Justice (DOJ), and other relevant stakeholders; and visited six of the 10 immigration courts selected based on geographic diversity and other factors. What GAO Found As GAO reported in June 2017, some immigration court experts and stakeholders have proposed restructuring the Executive Office of Immigration Review's (EOIR) immigration court system to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of the system or, among other things, increase the perceived independence of the system and professionalism and credibility of the workforce. GAO found that the 10 experts and stakeholders GAO interviewed generally supported one of the following scenarios for restructuring the immigration court system, all of which would require a statutory change to implement: a court system independent (i.e., outside) of the executive branch to replace EOIR's immigration court system, including both trial and appellate tribunals; a new, independent administrative agency within the executive branch to carry out EOIR's quasi-judicial functions with both trial-level immigration judges and an appellate level review board; or a hybrid approach, placing trial-level immigration judges in an independent administrative agency within the executive branch, and an appellate-level tribunal outside of the executive branch. Six of the 10 experts and stakeholders GAO interviewed supported restructuring the immigration court system into a court independent of the executive branch. Two of the experts and stakeholders GAO interviewed supported a new independent administrative agency within the executive branch. One of the experts and stakeholders supported the hybrid scenario, placing trial-level immigration judges in an independent, administrative agency within the executive branch, and an appellate-level tribunal outside of the executive branch.

SBA relies on lenders with delegated authority to make these determinations. SBA's 7(a) program is required to serve creditworthy small business borrowers who cannot obtain conventional credit at reasonable terms, and SBA largely relies on lenders with delegated authority to make these determinations. GAO was asked to review SBA's 7(a) program. This report examines (1) 7(a) lending to selected categories of small business borrowers from fiscal years 2007 through 2016; (2) how SBA monitors lenders' compliance with the credit elsewhere requirement; (3) the extent to which SBA evaluates trends in lender practices related to the credit elsewhere requirement; and (4) lenders' views on the criteria used to determine eligibility for 7(a) loans and other issues related to the 7(a) program. GAO analyzed SBA loan-level data on 7(a) loans and borrowers from fiscal years 2007 through 2016, reviewed SBA's standard operating procedures and other guidance on lender oversight, and interviewed agency officials and a nongeneralizable sample of 11 lenders selected based on size and other factors. What GAO Found From fiscal years 2007 through 2016, a majority of loan dollars guaranteed under the Small Business Administration's (SBA) 7(a) program went to small businesses that were new, partially or wholly owned by women, or located in a distressed area. The remaining 37 percent of 7(a) loan dollars went to businesses that were established, solely male-owned, and not located in economically distressed areas. SBA relies on on on-site reviews as its primary mechanism for evaluating lenders' compliance with the credit elsewhere requirement. SBA's standard operating procedures state that lenders must substantiate that credit is not available elsewhere by (1) discussing the criteria that demonstrate an identifiable weakness in a borrower's credit and (2) including the specific reasons why the borrower does not meet the lender's conventional loan policy requirements. SBA's contractors who conduct on-site reviews are supposed to assess whether lenders have adequately documented the credit elsewhere criteria and provided specific reasons supporting the criteria in the credit memorandum. SBA's contractors also told GAO that they carefully review a lender's loan policies in preparation for on-site reviews and refer to a lender",

In such cases, the United States can request assistance from the U.S. Competent Authority (USCA) to resolve disputes. GAO was asked to review the MAP process. This report examines the extent to which USCA evaluates the management of MAP cases. GAO reviewed IRS documents and data on MAP cases and interviewed IRS officials. GAO also reviewed a generalizable sample of MAP case files from 2013 to 2017 and a generalizable random sample of 84 MAP cases from 2015 to 2017. What GAO Found USCA provides information about the MAP process through an IRS web page on competent authority assistance. The website includes contact information for USCA offices and a link to a document that describes the process for requesting assistance. However, the website does not include an overview or high-level description of the MAP process. The website also lacked elements such as frequently asked questions or fact sheets that IRS has developed for similar processes that help promote understanding of complex tax issues. USCA officials said they are engaged in some efforts that may improve the information they provide to taxpayers. USCA officials stated that they are close to finalizing a \"practice unit\" explaining the competent authority process. However, USCA does not track key data or use existing data to assess the management of MAP cases. APMA does not have controls in place to systematically and routinely evaluate the quality of the data in its inventory of cases.

In recent years, Congress has expressed interest in expediting the delivery of such projects by substantially reducing the average length of the environmental review process. GAO was asked to review the extent to which the provisions aimed at accelerating the delivery of highway and transit projects are used by state departments of transportation (state DOT) and transit agencies and the provisions' reported effects, if any, on accelerating the delivery of projects. This report (1) identifies the provisions aimed at accelerating the delivery of highway and transit projects that were included in the last three surface transportation reauthorizations; (2) examines the extent to which the provisions were used by state DOTs and transit agencies and the provisions' reported effects, if any, on accelerating the delivery of projects; and (3) evaluates the extent to which DOT has assigned National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (NEPA) authority to states and the reported effects. GAO analyzed relevant statutes, regulations, and reports; surveyed state DOTs in all 50 states, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico; and interviewed officials from FHWA and FTA.

The exchanges are the federally facilitated exchanges that allow consumers to compare health insurance plans and select from a variety of plans. The exchanges are also the primary source of financial assistance for enrollees. The PPACA also required GAO to report on the program's enrollment. This report examines (1) the extent to which enrollment in 2018 was affected by factors other than plan affordability, and (2) the extent to which HHS's funding for the exchanges was used to promote enrollment. GAO reviewed relevant laws, regulations, and guidance; interviewed officials from HHS, the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), and other stakeholders; and reviewed relevant federal laws and regulations. What GAO Found About 8.7 million consumers enrolled in health insurance exchanges during the open enrollment period for 2018 coverage, 5 percent less than the 9.2 million who enrolled for 2017. This decline continues a trend from 2016, when a peak of 9.6 million consumers enrolled in such plans. Since that peak, enrollment has decreased by 9 percent. Enrollment in plans sold by state-based exchanges that use their own enrollment website has remained relatively stable during the same time period, with just over 3.0 million enrollees each year since 2016. Stakeholders GAO interviewed reported that plan affordability likely played a major role in 2018 exchange enrollment\u2014both attracting and detracting from enrollment\u2014and enrollees' plan selection. In 2018, premiums across all health insurance exchange plans increased an average of 30 percent\u2014more than expected given overall health cost trends. As a result of these premium increases, plans were less affordable in 2018 compared to 2017 for exchange consumers without advance premium tax credits (15 percent in 2018). Stakeholders also reported that a variety of other factors, such as consumer confusion about PPACA and its status, also likely affected 2018 exchange enrollment, but opinions on the impact of each factor were mixed. For example, most stakeholders GAO interviewed, including all 4 navigator organizations and 3 professional trade organizations, reported that consumer confusion about PPACA and its status likely played a major role in detracting from 2018 enrollment. However, other stakeholders reported that these reductions likely had no effect on enrollment, noting that most consumers who needed exchange-based coverage were already",

This report examines (1) the median cost of LIHTC projects completed in selected allocating agencies and (2) how allocating agencies manage and verify development costs. GAO analyzed LIHTC project-level data from 12 allocating agencies, reviewed relevant federal laws and regulations, and interviewed agency officials. What GAO Found The median per-unit cost of the Low-Income Housing Tax Credit (LIHTC) projects completed in 12 selected allocating agency jurisdictions in 2011\u20132015 was $204,000. The median per-unit cost of new construction projects was about $50,000 higher than for rehabilitation projects ($218,000 compared to about $169,000). For rehabilitation projects, the median per-unit cost was about $72,000 higher in urban areas than in nonurban areas (about $196,000 compared to $124,000). The median per-unit cost of rehabilitation projects decreased by about 21 percent (from about $207,000 to $153,000 in 2015 dollars). The median per-unit cost of new construction projects increased by about 13 percent during 2011\u20132015, and the median per-unit cost of rehabilitation projects decreased by about 21 percent (from about $207,000 to $153,000 in 2015 dollars). The median per-unit cost of new construction projects was about $230,000 higher in urban areas than in nonurban areas (about $230,000 compared to $192,000). For rehabilitation projects, the median per-unit cost was about $72,000 higher in urban areas than in nonurban areas (about $196,000 compared to $124,000).

The characteristics of each allocating agency's LIHTC projects generally can be expected to reflect the real estate conditions, built environment, and populations of the areas they serve. Allocating agencies used approaches that included cost and fee limits and cost-based scoring criteria to manage project-development costs.

This report examines (1) HHS's efforts to expand access to MAT for opioid use disorders and (2) selected stakeholders' views on HHS's efforts to expand access to MAT for opioid use disorders. GAO reviewed HHS documents and interviewed officials from HHS, the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), and other stakeholders. What GAO Found HHS has implemented five key efforts from 2015 through August 2017 that focus on expanding access to medication-assisted treatment (MAT) for opioid use disorders. Four of these are grant programs, including programs focused on health centers or primary care practices in rural areas. HHS's fifth key effort increases treatment capacity by expanding the waivers that practitioners may receive to prescribe buprenorphine. Specifically, the Safe, Accountable, Flexible, and Honest Services Administration (SAMHSA) issued a regulation that became effective August 8, 2016 increasing the number of patients that eligible practitioners can treat with buprenorphine outside of an opioid treatment program (OTP). Previously, qualified practitioners could request approval to treat up to 30 patients at a time, and after 1 year the limit could increase to 100 patients at a time upon SAMHSA approval. The new regulation expanded access to MAT by allowing eligible practitioners who have had waivers to prescribe buprenorphine to 100 patients for at least 1 year to request approval to treat up to 275 patients thereafter. HHS officials told GAO that as of August 2017, HHS is in the process of finalizing its approach for evaluating the implementation of its agencies' collective efforts to address the opioid epidemic that were undertaken as part of the HHS Opioid Initiative and will continue under the new administration's Opioid Strategy.

This testimony is based on GAO's September 2017 report, which examined (1) NASA's use of RPS and Pu-238, and (2) DOE's progress in meeting NASA's demand for Pu-238 to fuel RPS. GAO reviewed NASA and DOE planning documents and interviewed officials from DOE, NASA, and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA). What GAO Found NASA selects radioisotope thermoelectric system (RPS) for missions primarily based on scientific objectives and mission destinations. NASA officials GAO interviewed stated that mission selections were influenced by the limited amount of available Pu-238. However, several other factors may affect NASA's demand for RPS and Pu-238: Costs associated with missions that typically require RPS. According to NASA officials, RPS have typically been used on Flagship missions that cost $2 billion or more. NASA can support no more than one mission using RPS about every 4 years\u2014or two to three missions per decade\u2014based on expected agency funding levels. Technological advances may reduce the demand for Pu-238 and thus RPS. For example, advances in solar power technology have realistically expanded the ability to use solar power for missions for which it would not have been considered before, and these advances could help address low levels of light intensity for deep space missions. NASA also is developing new RPS technologies that may reduce its demand for Pu-238 and thus RPS. DOE has made progress meeting NASA's future demand for Pu-238 to fuel RPS.",
    "gao_GAO-18-602": "Why GAO Did This Study The U.S. Postal Service (USPS) provides retiree health benefits to postal retirees. USPS is required by law to pay its share of postal retiree health benefits. The 2006 Postal Accountability and Enhancement Act required USPS to start fully \"prefunding\" retiree health benefits. USPS has missed approximately $38 billion in payments to the fund since fiscal year 2010, and the fund's balance is declining. GAO was asked to review the financial outlook of the RHB Fund. This report examines (1) the financial outlook of the RHB Fund and (2) potential policy approaches to address the financial sustainability of postal retiree health benefits. GAO reviewed relevant laws, regulations, and reports; analyzed data from OPM and USPS on postal retiree health benefits; and interviewed officials from OPM, USPS, and companies that provide retiree health benefits. What GAO Found The RHB Fund is on an unsustainable path and is projected to be depleted in 12 years under the status quo. USPS has missed approximately $38 billion in payments to the fund since fiscal year 2010, and the fund's balance is declining. Beginning in fiscal year 2017, the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) started drawing from the fund to pay USPS's share of postal retiree health benefits. OPM's payments in that year exceeded the fund's income from interest, and OPM projects that, based on the status quo, future payments will continue to exceed the fund's income from interest. As long as USPS continues to miss its annual payments\u2014which were nearly $4.3 billion in fiscal year 2017 and are $4.5 billion in fiscal year 2018\u2014the fund is on track to be depleted in fiscal year 2030 based on OPM projections requested by GAO. The outlook for the RHB Fund is poor as USPS has inadequate resources to cover its required payments to the fund and, in GAO's view, based on past practices and USPS statements, appears unlikely to make partial payments. GAO's analysis of data from OPM and companies shows that most companies do not offer retiree health benefits and that the number of companies providing such benefits is decreasing over time. For example, the percentage of all private and public organizations (e.g., state or local governments) with more than 200 employees that offer employee health benefits and that also offer retiree health benefits is estimated",
    "gao_GAO-18-29": "Why GAO Did This Study The unauthorized disclosure of classified information has raised concerns about the timeliness of the federal government's security clearance process. In response, in 2014, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) initiated a reform effort to improve the security clearance process government-wide. GAO was asked to review the reform effort. This report examines the extent to which (1) the PAC has made progress in reforming the personnel security clearance process, and (2) the ODNI has taken steps to improve the timeliness of the process. GAO reviewed relevant legislation, executive orders, and PAC documents; analyzed timeliness data for specific executive branch agencies; and interviewed officials from OPM, DOD, and NBIB. What GAO Found The Office of Personnel Management's (OPM) Personnel Action Council (PAC) has made progress in reforming the personnel security clearance process government-wide, but long-standing key initiatives remain incomplete. For example, the PAC has issued guidance, such as quality assessment standards, to guide background investigations, updated strategic documents to sustain the momentum of the reform effort, and adjudicative guidelines to establish single, common adjudicative criteria for security clearances. However, implementing certain aspects of the 2012 Federal Investigative Standards, including full implementation of continuous evaluation, remains incomplete. In addition, while the executive branch has taken steps toward establishing performance measures for the quality of government-wide personnel security clearance investigations, there is no milestone for their completion. Executive branch agencies have experienced challenges in meeting timeliness objectives for investigation and adjudication of initial personnel security clearances, and their reporting on timeliness has been limited. The executive branch's reporting on timeliness has been limited, which inhibits both transparency and oversight of the personnel security clearance process. The executive branch's reporting on timeliness has been limited, which inhibits both transparency and oversight of the personnel security clearance process. The transition from the Federal Information System (FIS) to NBIB has involved organizational changes intended to improve the background investigation process, but the bureau faces operational challenges in addressing the investigation backlog and workforce planning. NBIB's organizational changes include the creation of some new departments, and DOD is now responsible for designing, developing, and maintaining a new information technology (IT) system for NBIB, but must contend with risks posed by vulnerabilities in OPM's legacy IT systems",

Indian students attend schools in areas with large numbers of Indian students. GAO was asked to review Indian students' access to public schools. This report examines the public school choice options located in areas with large populations of Indian students, collectively referred to as Indian students. GAO analyzed Education data for school year 2015-16 (the most recent available), analyzed Education data from the 100 school districts with the largest number of Indian students, and interviewed federal officials and academic subject matter experts. What GAO Found Few areas with large numbers of Indian students had options other than traditional public schools, according to GAO's analysis of Education data for school year 2015-16. Of the 451 school districts with high percentages of Indian students in GAO's analysis, 84 percent (378 districts) had only traditional public schools. The remaining 16 percent (73 districts) had at least one charter school, charter school, magnet school, or career and technical education school. The most common option was a Bureau of Indian Education (BIE) school. Among districts that had only traditional public schools, about three-quarters of them had more than one school. There are several reasons why there may be few public school options in districts with high percentages of Indian students. For example, nearly all of these districts are located in rural areas. Experts said there are often not enough students in rural areas to justify adding schools beyond the traditional public schools or BIE schools that already exist, and rural school districts can face challenges recruiting and retaining qualified teachers. In the 100 school districts with the largest number of Indian students, 75 percent of the schools were concentrated in 15 school districts. Indian students enrolled in charter schools in similar percentages as non-Indian students. In the remaining districts, enrollment patterns varied. For example, in one district near Boise, Idaho and another near Fairbanks, Alaska, Indian students attended charter schools at higher percentages than their peers by 60 percentage points and 6 percentage points, respectively. In the remaining districts, Indian students enrolled in magnet schools at lower percentages than non-Indian students. Whether Indian students enrolled in different types of schools could be a function of local differences in school choice and could be influenced by the extent to which these schools offered curricula that reflect Indian languages, cultures, or histories.

In fiscal year 2017, SNAP households spent about $2 billion on SNAP benefits. GAO was asked to review SNAP recipient fraud. This report examines (1) the extent to which SNAP households in selected states are making out-of-state purchases that may indicate potential recipient fraud; (2) the extent to which selected states are using data analytics\u2014including those applied to out-of-state transactions\u2014to find potential SNAP recipient fraud, and what advantages and challenges, if any, have they experienced doing so; and (3) how FNS has assisted states in implementing leading practices for data analytics for fraud detection. GAO analyzed SNAP transaction data from FNS for fiscal year 2017 and fiscal year 2017 in three states\u2014Division of Columbia, Massachusetts, Mississippi, New Mexico, North Dakota, Washington, and Wisconsin\u2014based on a range of factors, including the percentage of out-of-state SNAP households, receipt of related technical assistance, geographic region, and FNS's reports on their capacity to conduct data analysis. GAO also interviewed officials from seven selected states\u2014the District of Columbia, Massachusetts, Mississippi, New Mexico, North Dakota, Washington, and Wisconsin\u2014based on their experiences with data analytics. What GAO Found The Small Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) households in selected states made out-of-state purchases that may indicate potential recipient fraud, as allowed under the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) statute. In fiscal year 2017, about 5.5 million households made out-of-state SNAP purchases in the District of Columbia and two states\u2014North Dakota and Washington. In fiscal year 2017, less than 0.5 percent of households in these three states spent all their SNAP benefits in a non-border state. Using SNAP benefits in a non-border state over an extended period of time, such as purchases exclusively in a non-border state over multiple months, could be an indicator of program violations, including eligibility fraud. GAO's prior work has shown that the use of data analytics may help states identify suspicious household activity more easily than with data matching alone given the challenges associated with these systems. GAO's prior work also found that the use of data analytics may allow states to better identify households at risk of trafficking and make them a higher priority for",
    "gao_GAO-18-231": "Why GAO Did This Study DOD has long faced challenges in reducing unneeded infrastructure, and on five different occasions DOD has used the BRAC process to reduce excess infrastructure, transform the military, and promote jointness. GAO was asked to review DOD's implementation of BRAC 2005. This report assesses the extent that DOD (1) measured the achievement of goals for reducing excess infrastructure, transforming the military, and promoting jointness for BRAC 2005 and (2) implemented prior GAO recommendations and addressed any additional challenges faced in BRAC 2005 to improve performance for any future BRAC round. GAO reviewed BRAC 2005 and related documents, and interviewed officials from DOD, the military services, and communities surrounding the 23 installations closed in BRAC 2005. What GAO Found The Department of Defense (DOD) has implemented 33 of the 65 prior GAO recommendations that GAO identified in its work since 2004, and it has the opportunity to address additional challenges regarding communications and monitoring to improve any future Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC) round. Specifically, DOD implemented 1 of 12 recommendations, and it has agreed to implement another 7 recommendations should Congress authorize any future BRAC round. Additionally, GAO found that DOD can improve its communications during the analysis phase. For the implementation phase, DOD implemented 28 of 39 recommendations, and it has agreed to implement another 3 recommendations. Further, GAO found it can improve monitoring of mission-related changes. For the disposal phase, DOD implemented 4 of 14 recommendations, and it has agreed to implement another 8 recommendations. DOD officials identified challenges related to monitoring mission-related changes during the implementation phase of BRAC 2005, specifically when unforeseen circumstances developed that affected units' ability to carry out their missions following implementation or added difficulties to fulfilling the intent of the recommendation. For example, DOD did not have specific guidance for the military services to monitor mission-related changes that added difficulties to fulfilling the intent of BRAC recommendations. Without specific guidance to monitor and report mission-related changes that require significant changes to the recommendation business plans, DOD will not be able to effectively monitor the efficient use of space and the costs associated with implementing any future BRAC recommendations.

    "gao_GAO-18-554": "Why GAO Did This Study The Small Business Act encourages the participation of small businesses, including those owned and controlled by socially and economically disadvantaged individuals, in federal contracting. The Small Business Act also requires SBA to enter into contracts with other agencies and award subcontracts for performing those contracts to firms eligible for program participation. GAO was asked to review federal contracting with small businesses. This report examines (1) the amount federal agencies have obligated on advertising contracts over the 5 most recent fiscal years (2013 through 2017) and the amount going to small disadvantaged businesses (SDB) and those owned by minorities and women; and (2) the agencies that have directed the most advertising contract obligations to these businesses and how this has changed over time. GAO analyzed federal procurement data from the Federal Procurement Data System-Next Generation (FPDS-NG) and interviewed agency officials. What GAO Found Over the past 5 fiscal years (2013 through 2017), federal agencies have obligated on average about $870 million annually for advertising contracts, with about 13 percent (approximately $114 million annually) of these obligations going to specified businesses. This share of advertising contract obligations going to these businesses over fiscal years 2013 through 2017 was consistent with the share of total federal contracting obligations going to these businesses (also on average 13 percent over this period). The amount of advertising contract obligations going to these businesses nearly doubled from fiscal year 2013 to 2017 (from $75 million to $147 million) and also increased as a percent of total advertising contract obligations (from 9 percent of these obligations to 16 percent). Specified businesses also represented an increasing share of businesses receiving advertising contract obligations, from 30 percent (194 businesses) in fiscal year 2013 to 39 percent (250 businesses) in fiscal year 2017. The most notable increase over the 5-year timeframe, both in dollars and percentage terms, was in the women-owned category, which increased by $56 million, or 93 percent. The most notable increase over the 5-year timeframe, both in dollars and percentage terms, was in the women-owned category, which increased by $56 million, or 93 percent.

    "gao_GAO-18-230": "Why GAO Did This Study DOD has spent over $1.3 billion since 1990 to support its forces. DOD's excess capacity analysis is intended to provide Congress with information on the amount of excess capacity within DOD. The National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2016 included a provision for GAO to review DOD's 2017 excess capacity analysis. This report examines the extent to which DOD's 2017 report addressed or partially addressed the required elements. GAO reviewed DOD's 2017 report and interviewed DOD officials. What GAO Found The Department of Defense's (DOD) 2017 excess capacity analysis has limitations that affect the accuracy and analytical sufficiency of the estimate. Specifically, DOD's use of a 1989 baseline for excess capacity results in inaccurate estimates of excess capacity; DOD's methodology included assumptions that were not always reasonable; and DOD's approach to estimating excess capacity is not always sufficient or implemented consistently across the military departments. DOD recognizes the limitations of its analysis, specifically noting that the resulting percentages of excess capacity are at best indicators to justify the more detailed analysis of excess capacity provided by a full base realignment and closure (BRAC) round. Specifically, DOD used a baseline for the analysis that did not fully take into account changes in infrastructure needs since 1989, used assumptions in its analysis that are not reasonable, and used methods that were not sufficient or implemented consistently. These limitations resulted in excess capacity estimates that do not have the accuracy and analytical sufficiency to support decision making on future BRAC rounds. Without improvements to DOD's method of estimating excess capacity, DOD is not providing the information that Congress requires to make decisions concerning the management of excess infrastructure capacity within the department. Similarly, DOD does not have the information it needs to appropriately manage its infrastructure capacity and therefore cannot make informed decisions about what it needs to support its mission as land and infrastructure requirements of newer weapon systems are introduced. Moreover, the combined effect of neither DOD nor Congress having the information means that DOD will continue to experience challenges with funding related to its infrastructure and potential excess costs.",
    "gao_GAO-18-172": "Why GAO Did This Study TSA is responsible for securing all modes of transportation, including civil aviation. TSA has a policy for awarding and overseeing OTAs. TSA has used OTAs to meet a variety of mission requirements, including securing airports and law enforcement agencies. GAO was asked to review TSA's use of OTAs. This report examines (1) the extent to which TSA uses OTAs to reimburse airports and law enforcement agencies for the costs associated with TSA security programs, and (2) how TSA determines price and monitors selected OTAs. GAO reviewed TSA policies and procedures and interviewed TSA officials. GAO also reviewed 29 OTAs awarded by 8 TSA programs from fiscal years 2012 through 2016. What GAO Found From fiscal years 2012 through 2016, the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) reported obligating millions annually through OTAs, which amounted to at least $1.4 billion, or about 13 percent of its overall obligations during this time. Five TSA reimbursement programs used OTAs to partially or fully reimburse airports and law enforcement agencies for the allowable costs associated with TSA security programs such as the design and construction of checked baggage inline systems. These five reimbursement programs accounted for about 99 percent of the $1.1 billion that TSA obligated on OTAs that were awarded during this period. The remaining three non-reimbursement programs accounted for a small amount of obligations and awarded a low number of OTAs for services including intelligence analysis and the development of aviation standards. GAO's review of 29 OTAs awarded by 8 TSA programs from fiscal years 2012 through 2016 found that the methods used to determine price reasonableness and monitor these OTAs varied based on the complexity of the requirement. For example, for OTAs awarded by the Electronic Baggage Screening Program, TSA extensively evaluated proposed costs and more straightforwardly analyzed proposed costs. For OTAs awarded by the Checkpoint Janitorial and Utilities Program, TSA independently verified electricity prices set by the local power authority that TSA's contracting officer used to determine fair and reasonable pricing.

    "gao_GAO-18-236": "Why GAO Did This Study TSA is responsible for ensuring the security of the nation's aviation system. TSA's RAP is to allocate staff to nearly 440 airports and oversee passenger and checked baggage screening. In 2007, GAO recommended that TSA periodically assess the assumptions used in the RAP to ensure that staffing allocations accurately reflect operating conditions that may change over time. In response, TSA implemented this recommendation by developing an evaluation plan for regularly assessing the assumptions used in the RAP. GAO was asked to review TSA's RAP. This report examines (1) how TSA has modified its RAP staffing assumptions and relies on airport information to tailor TSA staffing levels to individual airports, and (2) how TSA monitors airport operations and responds to increases in passenger wait times and throughput. GAO reviewed TSA documents and interviewed TSA officials at headquarters and eight airports selected based on passenger volume and other factors. GAO also visited eight airports selected based on airport size and other factors. What GAO Found The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) has modified its RAP staffing assumptions and relies on airport information to tailor TSA staffing levels to individual airports. In fiscal years 2016 and 2017, TSA modified the assumptions used in its model, as needed, to reflect changes identified through annual evaluations performed by a contractor. For example, in fiscal year 2017, TSA increased the expected time needed to screen passengers for one type of passenger screening equipment because the contractor found that the actual time needed was more than the assumption TSA used in fiscal year 2016. In addition, in fiscal year 2016, TSA allocated fewer staff to review images of checked baggage, compared to previous years, because the contractor's evaluation determined it took TSA less time to review the images than the time observed in previous years. TSA uses airport-specific information to tailor TSA staffing levels to individual airport needs. For example, beginning in fiscal year 2016, TSA used passenger throughput forecasts to allocate staff commensurate with the expected rate of increase in passenger throughput at each airport. TSA officials at both the headquarters and airport levels use airport-specific information to tailor staffing levels to individual airport needs. For example, officials at one airport said they had been granted exceptions for one checkpoint because pillars and curves within the checkpoint prevented the lanes in the checkpoint from screening passengers at the rate assumed",
    "gao_GAO-18-100": "Why GAO Did This Study In 2016, Medicare spent about $380 billion on health care services for beneficiaries enrolled in Medicare FFS, which consists of two separate parts: Medicare Part A, which primarily covers hospital services, and Medicare Part B, which primarily covers outpatient services. The majority of the 38 million Medicare FFS beneficiaries were enrolled in both Part A and Part B, although about 5 million were enrolled in Part A only and 0.3 million were enrolled in Part B only. The current Medicare FFS cost-sharing design leaves beneficiaries exposed to potentially catastrophic cost-sharing, and in part because of that, in 2015, 81 percent of Medicare FFS beneficiaries obtained supplemental insurance that covered some or all of their Medicare cost-sharing responsibilities, often in exchange for an additional premium. GAO was asked to review the design of Medicare FFS cost-sharing. This report examines (1) the extent to which Medicare FFS cost-sharing can be confusing, contribute to beneficiaries' overuse of services, and leave beneficiaries exposed to catastrophic costs, and (2) the effect of implementing a modernized design on beneficiaries' cost-sharing responsibilities. GAO analyzed relevant literature and interviewed officials from CMS, the Medicare Payment Advisory Commission, and others. GAO also reviewed four illustrative cost-sharing designs that GAO analyzed and interviewed experts. What GAO Found The current Medicare fee-for-service (FFS) cost-sharing design can be confusing, contribute to beneficiaries' overuse of services, and leave beneficiaries exposed to catastrophic costs. Modernizing the design could address these concerns, but would involve trade-offs. For example, maintaining Medicare's share of costs would involve a trade-off between the level of the cap and the deductible (or other cost-sharing). The direct effect of modernizing the Medicare FFS cost-sharing design (i.e., the effect when holding utilization and enrollment constant) on beneficiaries' cost-sharing responsibilities would depend on specific revisions and the time horizon examined. For example, if the design had a cap near $10,000, the median annual cost-sharing responsibility would be $479, which is below that of the current design ($621), despite the addition of a cap. In contrast, designs with relatively low caps\u2014and therefore greater beneficiary protection from catastrophic costs\u2014would result in a median annual beneficiary cost-sharing responsibility above that of the current design.

In fiscal year 2017, VHA obligated $24.6 million to the contract for media outreach related to both suicide prevention and mental health. GAO was asked to review VHA's suicide prevention media outreach campaign. This report examines (1) the extent to which VHA's suicide prevention media outreach activities have declined since fiscal year 2017, and (2) the extent to which VHA monitors the effectiveness of its suicide prevention media outreach campaign. GAO reviewed relevant federal laws, regulations, and VHA documents; interviewed VA officials; and analyzed VHA's suicide prevention media outreach budget and monitoring reports. What GAO Found The Department of Veterans Affairs' (VA) Veterans Health Administration's (VHA) suicide prevention media outreach activities declined in fiscal years 2017 and 2018 compared to earlier years of the campaign. For example, VHA reported that its contractor developed 339 pieces of social media content in fiscal year 2016, compared with 159 in fiscal year 2017, and 47 during the first 10 months of fiscal year 2018. VHA also reported that its contractor developed two suicide prevention public service announcements (PSA) in each fiscal year. VHA officials said that the development of the PSA was delayed in fiscal year 2018. Specifically, as of August 2018, VHA reported that one PSA was completed, but had not yet aired, and another PSA was in development. As a result, VHA had not aired a PSA on television or radio in over a year; this is the first time there has been a gap of more than a month since June 2012. VHA officials said that the decrease in suicide prevention media outreach activities was due to leadership turnover and reorganization in the office responsible for suicide prevention activities in 2017. For example, VHA filled the position temporarily with a 6-month detail from another agency from October 2017 through March 2018 and then hired this individual as the permanent director on April 30, 2018. VHA officials that worked on the campaign told GAO they did not have leadership available to make decisions about the suicide prevention media outreach campaign during this time. The absence of leadership available to provide direction and make decisions on the suicide prevention media outreach campaign is inconsistent with federal internal control standards for control environment, which require agencies to assign responsibilities to achieve its objectives.

    "gao_GAO-18-127": "Why GAO Did This Study In 2014, some passenger vehicle manufacturers began recalling Takata air bag inflators, recalls that have grown to include approximately 34 million vehicles and 19 auto manufacturers. NHTSA is responsible for identifying and addressing defective vehicles and ensuring their safety. In 2016, NHTSA began consolidating its websites into NHTSA.gov, which provides safety recall information to consumers. GAO was asked to review NHTSA's efforts to raise consumer awareness about auto recalls. This report examines (1) how consumers and industry stakeholders use publicly available auto recall information, (2) how easy or difficult consumers find the auto recall areas of NHTSA.gov, and (3) steps, if any, NHTSA has taken to raise consumer awareness about auto recalls and how NHTSA evaluated the effectiveness of these steps. GAO analyzed NHTSA data on recall completion rates and consumer responses to a questionnaire, conducted 12 focus groups with 94 consumers, and interviewed agency officials and industry stakeholders. What GAO Found As part of GAO's focus group discussion sessions, consumers selected safety risk and convenience as the two most influential factors they considered when using auto recall information to decide whether to complete repairs. Consumers in GAO's focus group discussion sessions overwhelmingly selected safety risk and convenience as the two most influential factors they considered when making repair decisions. For example, some consumers described the \"hassle\" of the repair and being \"too busy\" to schedule and fix the defect, while others said they repaired their vehicles more easily because, for example, they could take advantage of previously scheduled service appointments to also repair the defect. Industry stakeholders' use of publicly available auto recall information varies because these stakeholders play different roles in the auto recall process. Auto manufacturers are primarily responsible for providing auto recall information to the public and others, including the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA). In addition, auto dealers are responsible for performing the recall remedy for manufacturers and therefore use manufacturer-provided information for that purpose. In addition, most consumers in GAO's focus group discussion sessions reported a preference to receive auto recall notification by mail, and all but 4 reported actually receiving mailed notification. However, 69 of the 94 consumers in GAO's focus group discussion sessions also reported a preference for receiving recall notification by electronic means, but only 7 reported actually receiving at least one type of electronic notification. This result suggests a gap between",

SMCRA requires that financial assurances be sufficient to ensure that the federal government has sufficient funds to complete required reclamation if the operator does not do so. GAO was asked to review financial assurances for coal mine reclamation. This report examines (1) the amount of financial assurances that state regulatory authorities and OSMRE held for reclaiming coal mines and (2) challenges OSMRE and state regulatory authorities face in managing these assurances. GAO reviewed relevant federal laws and regulations, OSMRE and state regulatory authority data, and relevant federal laws and regulations. GAO also interviewed federal and state regulatory authority officials, representatives from the mining and financial assurance industries, and representatives from environmental nongovernmental organizations. What GAO Found State regulatory authorities and the Office of Surface Mining Reclamation and Enforcement (OSMRE) reported holding a total of approximately $10.2 billion in surety bonds, collateral bonds, and self-bonds as financial assurances for coal mine reclamation in 2017. Of the total amount of financial assurances, approximately 76 percent ($7.8 billion) were in the form of surety bonds, 12 percent ($1.2 billion) in collateral bonds, and 12 percent ($1.2 billion) in self-bonds.

OSMRE and state regulatory authorities reported that operators forfeited more than 450 financial assurances for reclaiming coal mines between July 2007 and June 2016, with 13 of the 25 states reporting at least one forfeiture. OSMRE has taken steps to oversee financial assurances and aspects of the mining and reclamation process that can affect whether the amount of financial assurances obtained will cover the cost of required reclamation. For example, OSMRE periodically reviews financial assurance amounts, inspects mine sites, and reviews state programs that implement SMCRA.

VHA policy requires that VHA-operated and contracted CBOCs provide the same standard of care to veterans that is of high quality. GAO was asked to review VHA's oversight of CBOCs. This report examines (1) the extent to which VHA-operated and contracted CBOCs provide the same standard of care and expenditures, and (2) the extent to which VHA has implemented oversight requirements and used the CBOC Report to oversee CBOCs. GAO reviewed VHA policies and procedures, and interviewed VHA officials.

NASA's ESD organization is responsible for integrating the three programs into a system. GAO was asked to review NASA's integration efforts. This report assesses (1) the benefits and challenges of NASA's approach for integrating and assessing the programmatic and technical readiness of SLS, Orion, and EGS; and (2) the extent to which ESD is managing cross-program risks that could affect launch readiness. GAO reviewed NASA policies and procedures, analyzed ESD risk data, and interviewed NASA officials. What GAO Found The National Aeronautics and Space Administration's (NASA) approach for integrating and assessing the programmatic and technical readiness of its current human spaceflight programs, executed by the Exploration Systems Development (ESD), differs from prior NASA human spaceflight programs. ESD manages both the programmatic and technical cross-program integration, and primarily relies on personnel within each program to implement its integration efforts. ESD's integration approach offers some cost and potential efficiency benefits relative to NASA's most recent human spaceflight effort, the Constellation program. However, it also brings challenges specific to its structure. In particular, NASA is already contractually obligating money on SLS and EGS for EM-2, but the lack of cost and schedule baselines for these programs will make it difficult to assess progress over time. Additionally, the approach creates an environment of competing interests because it relies on dual- hatted staff to manage technical and safety aspects on behalf of ESD while also serving as independent oversight of those same areas. ESD has made progress reducing risks over the past 2 years, but key integration risk areas remain for the integration effort. For example, delays with the European Service Module\u2014which will provide services to the Orion crew capsule\u2014could affect the Orion program's schedule. ESD is putting a new method in place to measure how well these software efforts are progressing along their respective critical paths. ESD officials have indicated, however, that identifying and establishing appropriate indicators is taking longer than expected and proving more difficult than anticipated. ESD officials also stated that they expect to continue to encounter and resolve software development issues",

DNN's program management policy includes leading practices for program management, such as establishing schedules and cost estimates covering the life cycle of DNN programs and subprograms. GAO was asked to review DNN's program management. This report examines the extent to which (1) selected subprograms within DNN use program management leading practices to manage schedule and cost, and (2) DNN has incorporated program management leading practices in its revised program management policy. GAO selected four DNN subprograms\u2014Nuclear Material Removal, High Enriched Uranium Reactor Conversion, Radiological Security, and International Nuclear Security\u2014based on their work scope and work scope indicating that they had project-like aspects. GAO reviewed DNN's program management policy and interviewed DNN officials. What GAO Found The four selected Department of Defense (DOD) subprograms GAO selected for review generally do not use selected leading program management practices to manage schedule and cost. Specifically, none of the subprograms had schedule and cost estimates that encompassed its entire life cycle, although one subprogram planned to develop such estimates for its recently-extended life cycle. In addition, none of the selected subprograms measure their overall schedule and cost performance against baseline estimates. NNSA officials said that the subprograms had not developed schedule and cost estimates that cover their life cycles and did not measure the subprograms against baselines due, in part, to uncertainty in planning scope and schedules that rely on the cooperation of other countries. DNN also does not require subprograms to have such estimates or to measure performance against schedule and cost baselines. Following these practices, however, would provide NNSA managers and other stakeholders more complete information to evaluate how much the subprograms may cost to achieve their goals, the amount of time they may need to achieve these goals, and their actual versus planned performance. DNN's 2017 revised program management policy includes some leading practices, but does not address life-cycle schedule and cost management for DNN programs or subprograms.

In 2012, the OIG reported that AMS had not consistently implemented its guidelines for conducting periodic internal reviews of its check-off programs. GAO was asked to review AMS's oversight of check-off programs. This report examines (1) AMS's response to recommendations made by the OIG and (2) the extent to which check-off evaluations show a positive return to assessment payers. GAO reviewed USDA's guidelines and standard operating procedures for the 22 check-off programs and interviewed agency officials and industry representatives. What GAO Found The Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS) has responded to recommendations made by the U.S. Department of Agriculture's (USDA) Office of Inspector General (OIG) in 2012, particularly by developing and implementing standard operating procedures and conducting internal reviews of AMS check-off program oversight. However, AMS does not provide consistent oversight across check-off programs in some areas; specifically, it does not routinely review check-off program subcontracts during its management reviews, conduct follow-up on management review recommendations, ensure that financial assurances are included in annual audits, or ensure that check-off boards share information with assessment payers on program websites. In conducting their oversight of the check-off programs, agency officials and marketing specialists said they face challenges because of increased use of social media, the absence of an information system for tracking approvals, and complex Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests for some programs, which may delay the completion of some oversight priorities. AMS officials identified ongoing challenges in check-off program oversight. In particular, AMS marketing specialists and senior agency officials identified three challenges: (1) the increase in some check-off boards' use of social media, (2) the absence of an information system to track approvals, and (3) complex and time-consuming FOIA requests for some programs. Because of competing priorities, some oversight duties may be delayed as a result. The eight independent economic evaluations GAO reviewed showed a positive return to assessment payers, but the evaluations varied in how they were conducted and revealed certain methodological limitations. According to agency officials and the economists who conducted the evaluations, the variations are in part due to the differences in check",

VHA is responsible for overseeing VAMCs' RME reprocessing efforts. GAO was asked to review VA's RME reprocessing efforts. This report examines (1) VHA's oversight of VAMCs' RME reprocessing efforts and (2) the challenges VAMCs report in operating their SPS programs and ensuring access to safe care. GAO reviewed VHA policies and procedures, analyzed VHA inspection reports, and interviewed officials from VHA, the Veterans Integrated Service Networks (VISN), and VAMCs. What GAO Found The Veterans Health Administration (VHA) has not ensured that it has complete information from the annual inspections of VAMCs conducted by VISNs\u2014a key oversight tool providing the most current VA-wide information on adherence to reusable medical equipment (RME) policies\u2014and therefore does not have reasonable assurance that VAMCs are following RME policies intended to ensure veterans are receiving safe care. For fiscal year 2017, GAO determined that VHA should have had records of 144 VISN SPS inspection reports to have assurance that all required VISN SPS inspections had been conducted. However, GAO determined that there were two VISNs from which VHA did not have any fiscal year 2017 reports. For the missing VISN inspection reports, VISN officials suggested several reasons why the inspections were either not conducted or conducted but the reports were not submitted to VHA. For the missing VISN inspection reports, VISN officials suggested several reasons why the inspections were either not conducted or conducted but the reports were not submitted to VHA. GAO also found that variation in VHA's inspection tools and related guidance resulted in incomplete inspection results for the gastroenterology and dental areas. GAO also found that VHA does not consistently share information, particularly inspection results, with VISNs and VAMCs, and that VISNs and VAMCs would like more of this information. Until this sharing becomes a regular practice, VHA is missing an opportunity to help ensure adherence to its RME policies. According to officials from all of the VISNs and selected VAMCs, the top five challenges VAMCs face in operating their S",

In fiscal year 2017, federal agencies reported obligating more than $15 billion on IT-related contracts and orders. GAO was asked to review the use of noncompetitive contracts for IT products and services. This report examines (1) the extent to which agencies used noncompetitive contracts to procure IT products and services for fiscal years 2013 through 2017, (2) the reasons for using noncompetitive contracts for selected IT procurements, (3) the extent to which IT procurements at selected agencies were bridge contracts, and (4) the extent to which noncompetitive IT procurements at selected agencies were in support of legacy systems. GAO analyzed government-wide and IT contract obligations data from fiscal years 2013 through 2017, reviewed a generalizable sample of 142 IT contracts and orders, and interviewed agency officials. What GAO Found Federal agencies reported obligating between $53 billion in fiscal year 2013 and $59 billion in fiscal year 2017 on information technology (IT)-related products and services. Of that amount, agencies reported that more than $15 billion each year\u2014or about 30 percent of all IT obligations\u2014were awarded noncompetitively. However, in a generalizable sample of contracts and orders, GAO found significant errors in certain types of orders, which call into question the reliability of competition data associated with roughly $3 billion per year in obligations. As a result, the actual amount agencies obligated on noncompetitive contract awards for IT products and services is unknown. GAO estimates that about 8 percent of fiscal year 2016 IT noncompetitive contracts and orders were bridge contracts. Consistent with GAO's October 2015 findings, agencies GAO reviewed face continued challenges with oversight of bridge contracts, based on 15 contracts and orders GAO reviewed in-depth. For example, GAO found that in 9 of the 15 cases, bridge contracts were associated with additional bridges not apparent in the documentation related to the contract and order GAO reviewed, such as a joint and agreement (J&A). In addition, GAO found two additional bridge contracts related to GAO's generalizable sample while conducting its in-depth review, bringing the total number of bridge contracts GAO identified during this review to 15.

The FAR provides that executive branch agencies should consider whether it is more economical to lease equipment rather than purchase it and identifies factors agencies should consider in this analysis, such as estimated length of the period that the equipment is to be used, the extent of use in that time period, and maintenance costs. GAO was asked to review heavy equipment. This report addresses (1) the number, type, and cost of heavy equipment items that are owned by the 24 CFO Act agencies; (2) the heavy equipment items selected agencies have recently acquired and how selected agencies decided to purchase or lease this equipment; and (3) how selected agencies manage the utilization of their heavy equipment. GAO analyzed inventory data from the 24 CFO Act agencies and interviewed agency officials. GAO also reviewed agency guidance and interviewed officials at the Departments of the Interior, Defense, and Energy, among others. What GAO Found Twenty agencies reported data on their owned heavy equipment, including the (1) number, (2) types, (3) acquisition year, and (4) location of agencies' owned heavy equipment in their inventories as of June 2017. The 20 agencies reported owning over 136,000 heavy equipment items, including over 100,000 items, about 74 percent. Four agencies\u2014the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, the Department of Housing and Urban Development, the Office of Personnel Management, and the Agency for International Development\u2014reported owning five or fewer heavy equipment items each. The 20 agencies reported acquiring their owned heavy equipment between 1944 and 2017, with an average of about 13 years since acquisition. The heavy equipment items reported by the 20 agencies ranged in acquisition cost from zero dollars to over $2 million in 2016 dollars, with an average acquisition cost of about $78,000, excluding assets with a reported acquisition cost of $0. Of the items which GAO adjusted to 2016 dollars and for which non-zero acquisition costs were provided, 94 percent cost less than $250,000 and accounted for 57 percent of the total adjusted acquisition costs. Three selected agencies\u2014the U.S. Air Force, the Fish and Wildlife Service, and the National Park Service\u2014purchased almost 3,500 pieces of heavy equipment in calendar years 2012 through 2016, but did not consistently document lease-versus-purchase analyses.

DOD uses foreign currency budget rates to determine its funding needs and calculate any gains or losses that result from overseas expenditures. GAO was asked to review DOD's foreign currency budget rates. This report (1) describes DOD's revised foreign currency budget rates since 2009 and the relationship between the revised budget rates and DOD's projected O&M and MILPERS funding needs, and (2) evaluates the extent to which DOD has taken steps to reduce costs in selecting foreign currency rates at which to make disbursements and determine whether opportunities exist to gain additional savings. GAO analyzed DOD's budget rates and DOD's financial reporting on foreign currency gains and losses for fiscal years 2009 through 2016, and interviewed DOD and service officials. What GAO Found The Department of Defense (DOD) revised its foreign currency budget rates in fiscal years 2014 through 2016, which resulted in budget rates that were more closely aligned with rates published by the U.S. Treasury Department (Treasury). DOD's revised budget rates decreased DOD's projected O&M and MILPERS funding needs and any potential gains and losses that would have occurred due to foreign currency fluctuations during fiscal years 2014 through 2016. DOD's use of revised budget rates decreased DOD's projected O&M and MILPERS funding needs and any potential gains and losses that would have occurred due to foreign currency fluctuations during fiscal years 2014 through 2016. DOD has taken some steps to reduce costs in selecting foreign currency rates to liquidate its obligations through disbursements, but DOD organizations are not always selecting the most cost-effective rates to convert U.S. Dollars, and DOD has not determined whether opportunities exist to achieve additional efficiencies when making disbursements.

In May 2018, VA awarded a contract to Cerner Systems to replace the 130 instances of VistA that it currently uses. GAO was asked to review VA's efforts to develop and sustain the Cerner system. This report (1) determines the extent to which VA has defined the system, (2) evaluates VA's annual costs to develop and sustain VistA, and (3) describes the actions VA has taken to transition from VistA to the Cerner system. GAO reviewed VA documentation and interviewed VA officials. What GAO Found The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) has begun to acquire a new system after a long history of efforts to modernize the Veterans Health Information Systems and Technology Architecture (VistA). However, these efforts were abandoned due to expectations of high costs and challenges to ensuring interoperability of health data. Beginning in December 2013, VA initiated VistA Evolution, a joint program between the department's Office of Information and Technology (OIT) and the Veterans Health Administration (VHA). According to VA, VistA Evolution was intended to result in lower costs for system upgrades, maintenance, and sustainment. However, the planned scope of work was reduced as VA redirected the department's efforts. Specifically, in June 2017, the former VA Secretary announced a significant shift in the department's approach to modernizing VistA. Rather than continue with the system, the Secretary stated that the department planned to acquire the same electronic health record (EHR) system that DOD is acquiring\u2014Cerner Millennium. Accordingly, the department awarded an indefinite delivery, indefinite quantity contract to Cerner in May 2018 for a maximum amount of $10 billion over 10 years. Cerner is to replace the 130 instances of VistA with a standard COTS system to be implemented across VA. The Cerner system is to support a broad range of health care functions including acute care, clinical decision support, dental care, and emergency medicine. When implemented, the Cerner system will be expected to become the authoritative source of clinical data to support improved health, patient safety, and quality of care provided by VA.

DHS also conducts voluntary vulnerability assessments for CI owners and operators. GAO was asked to review DHS's CI risk assessment efforts. This report examines (1) DHS's CI risk assessment activities and (2) how DHS uses CI risk information to inform strategic planning and inform outreach to owners and operators. GAO reviewed DHS documents and interviewed DHS officials and selected private sector representatives from three selected sectors\u2014the Nuclear Reactors, Materials and Waste, and Transportation Systems\u2014based on their CI risk assessment responsibilities and other factors. What GAO Found The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) primarily assesses the three elements of risk\u2014threat, vulnerability, and consequence\u2014eparately for critical infrastructure (CI) owners and operators. According to DHS officials, these assessments help critical infrastructure owners and operators take actions to improve security and mitigate risks. However, according to selected private sector representatives, timely and actionable threat assessment data is the most useful type of risk information. In limited circumstances, DHS generates risk assessments that collectively incorporate all three elements of risk which selected SCC representatives found of limited use for their sectors' infrastructure protection efforts due to the amount of time it takes to finalize the assessment data, the inclusion of risk scenarios that are not likely to occur, and the results not being applicable to individual assets.

However, as GAO has previously reported, investments in federal IT too often result in failed projects that incur cost overruns and schedule slippages, while contributing little to the desired mission-related outcomes. FITARA was intended to improve covered agencies' acquisitions of IT and enable Congress to monitor agencies' progress and hold them accountable for reducing duplication and achieving cost savings. This testimony is based on GAO's prior work on federal IT acquisitions and operations and updates information from OMB and agencies on the status of GAO's prior recommendations. This statement is based on GAO's prior work on federal IT acquisitions and operations and updates information from OMB and agencies on the status of GAO's prior recommendations. What GAO Found The federal government has taken steps to improve the management of information technology (IT) acquisitions and operations. However, agencies would be better positioned to realize billions in cost savings and additional management improvements, if they addressed the numerous recommendations GAO has made aimed at improving data center consolidation, increasing transparency via OMB's IT Dashboard, implementing incremental development, managing software licenses, reviewing IT acquisitions, implementing key IT workforce activities, and addressing legacy systems. Specifically, in May 2017, GAO reported that the 24 agencies participating in the Federal Data Center Consolidation Initiative (FDCCI) collectively had made progress on their data center closure efforts. Specifically, as of August 2016, these agencies had identified a total of 9,995 data centers, of which they reported having closed 4,388, and having plans to close a total of 5,597 data centers through fiscal year 2019. Notably, the Departments of Agriculture, Defense, the Interior, and the Treasury accounted for 84 percent of the completed closures.

GAO was asked to review the technology sector. This report examines (1) trends in the technology workforce over the past decade, and (2) efforts by EEOC and OFCCP to oversee technology companies and technology contractors' compliance with equal employment opportunity and affirmative action requirements. GAO analyzed a nongeneralizable sample of 2015 American Community Survey (ACS) data on technology workers within and outside the technology sector, and interviewed EEOC and OFCCP officials. What GAO Found From 2005 to 2015, the estimated number of workers in the technology sector\u2014people who worked in mathematics, computing, or engineering occupations\u2014increased at a higher rate (24 percent) than the estimated number of workers in the general workforce (9 percent), according to ACS data. In 2015, the technology workforce comprised an estimated 7.5 million workers, an increase of slightly over 1.4 million workers since 2005. Specifically, women represented 22 percent (about 1.6 million workers) of workers in technology occupations, compared to 48.7 percent of workers in the general workforce. In contrast, Asian workers were an increasing share of the technology workforce, where they remained more represented than they were in the general workforce. Several factors may contribute to the lower representation of women and certain minority groups in the technology workforce and at companies in the technology sector, based on research and interviews with researchers and representatives from workforce and industry organizations and technology companies. These include the lower diversity of degree earners in technology-related fields, and company-based factors such as hiring practices and retention of women and underrepresented minorities. EEOC and OFCCP have taken steps to oversee compliance with equal employment opportunity and affirmative action requirements, but face limitations. EEOC primarily oversees compliance with equal employment opportunity requirements by investigating workers' individual charges of employment discrimination filed against companies. However, GAO was unable to identify a specific number of charges received by EEOC against companies in industries that are part of this sector because EEOC does not require investigators to record the industry of the charged company. EEOC officials in both the San Francisco and New York district offices told GAO that, while they cannot readily identify individual charges against technology companies, they believe they have received far fewer charges against technology companies than they would have",

CMS began phasing in the competitive bidding program (CBP) in 2008 and has implemented several other broader initiatives. CMS has also implemented several other broader initiatives. GAO was asked to review the implementation of adjusted rates in non-bid areas. This report examines (1) the extent to which the payment rates have affected beneficiary access to durable medical equipment (DME) items and (2) the extent to which CMS has monitored beneficiary access to DME items and health outcomes in non-bid areas. GAO analyzed CMS data on payments for 393 rate-adjusted items and interviewed CMS officials and representatives from four DME industry trade organizations. What GAO Found The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) used payment information from the CBP to adjust payment rates for 393 durable medical equipment (DME) items in non-bid areas. Most of these items were included in at least one CBP round; however, some are no longer included in current CBP rounds. For example, 81 items with adjusted rates were not included in the CBP rounds that were in effect at the end of calendar year 2016. CMS used different methodologies to adjust FFS payment rates in non-bid areas. These adjustments are based on CBP payment information depending on the number of CBP areas in which a particular item has been competitively bid and the geographic area in which the adjusted rate is applied. For example, for an item that is competitively bid in more than 10 CBP areas and is furnished to beneficiaries residing in non-rural areas of the contiguous United States, CMS calculates a separate adjusted rate for each of eight geographic regions. In each region, the item's average regional adjusted rate reflects the unweighted average competitively bid rate for all CBP areas located fully or partially within the region.

CMS is responsible for overseeing states' claims for federal Medicaid funds. GAO was asked to review CMS's oversight of states' expenditures. This report examines (1) how CMS ensures that states report expenditures that are supported and allowable and (2) the extent to which CMS has resolved errors in reported expenditures. GAO reviewed CMS documents and interviewed CMS officials in headquarters and 10 selected states, selected based on program size and other factors. GAO also reviewed CMS documents and interviewed CMS officials in headquarters and 10 selected states. What GAO Found The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) uses a variety of processes to ensure that state-reported expenditures are supported and allowable, but weaknesses limit its ability to effectively target risk. CMS uses a variety of processes to ensure that state-reported expenditures are supported during quarterly reviews and performs focused financial management reviews on expenditures considered at risk of not complying with Medicaid requirements. GAO found that CMS was identifying errors and compliance issues using both review methods, but also found weaknesses in how CMS targets its oversight resources to address risks. For example, CMS has allocated similar staff resources to states with differing levels of risk, and has cancelled the requirement to conduct a financial management review (FMR) for regional offices in 17 out of 51 instances in the last 5 years when faced with resource constraints. CMS also has not conducted a comprehensive, national risk assessment to determine whether resources for financial oversight are adequate and allocated commensurate with risk. Without completing a comprehensive, national risk assessment and determining whether staff resources dedicated to financial oversight are adequate and allocated commensurate with risk, CMS is missing an opportunity to improve its ability to identify errors in reported expenditures that could result in hundreds of millions of dollars in potential savings to the Medicaid program. GAO found weaknesses in CMS's review of expenditures for which states receive higher federal matching rates. For example, GAO found that CMS did not consistently conduct variance analyses\u2014which compare changes in expenditures from the quarter under review to the previous quarter\u2014of expenditures for the Medicaid expansion population, a category that accounted for nearly $7 billion in Medicaid expenditures in fiscal year 2016. Further, the sampling procedures used to examine Medicaid expansion expenditures did not account for varying risks across states. For example, GAO found",

This report examines (1) the extent to which fees for accessing patient medical records vary by type of request and state, and (2) stakeholders' views on challenges patients face accessing medical records and challenges providers face in allocating resources to respond to requests. GAO reviewed relevant federal laws, regulations, and guidance; analyzed HIPAA and HIPAA Privacy Rule data; and interviewed stakeholders, including patient advocates, providers, and others. GAO also reviewed HIPAA and HIPAA Privacy Rule guidance and interviewed HHS officials and representatives from ROI vendors, providers, and patient advocates. What GAO Found Available information suggests that the allowable fees for accessing patient medical records vary by type of request\u2014that is, whether a patient or third party is making the request\u2014and by state. Federal laws establish limits on the fees that may be charged for two of the three types of requests for medical records: (1) patient requests, when patients request access to their medical records, and (2) patient-directed requests, when patients request that their records be sent to another person or entity, such as another provider.

To enforce patients' right of access under HIPAA's Privacy Rule, the Department of Health and Human Services' (HHS) Office of Compliance Review (OCR) investigates complaints it receives from patients and others regarding access to patient medical records, audits a sample of providers to determine the extent to which their policies and procedures",
    "gao_GAO-18-30": "Why GAO Did This Study FEMA's Public Assistance (PA) program is a multibillion dollar program that provides grants to states and localities to help them rebuild and recover from disasters. FEMA's Public Assistance program is designed to help applicants develop and submit applications for PA grants. GAO was asked to review FEMA's PA program. This report examines (1) the extent to which FEMA designed and implemented the new PA delivery model, and (2) the extent to which FEMA's new information system is implemented effectively. GAO reviewed FEMA's 2014 PA Program Realignment report and other program documents, and interviewed program officials and stakeholders. What GAO Found The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) designed the new PA delivery model to respond to persistent workforce management challenges related to identifying the required number of staff and needed skills and training, among other things, to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the PA preaward process. To address these challenges, PA program officials centralized much of the responsibility for processing PA projects in the Consolidated Resource Centers (CRC), created additional new positions with specialized roles and responsibilities in Joint Field Offices (JFO), and established training and mentoring programs to help build the new staffs' skills. PA officials also emphasized the need for FEMA to provide additional training for state and local officials to build capacity and support the goals of the new delivery model. PA officials also identified workforce challenges related to identifying the number of staff needed to support the new delivery model for all future disasters. For example, PA officials did not fully assess the workforce needed for JFO field operations, CRC staff, or FEMA's hazard mitigation staff to support implementation of the new delivery model for all future disasters. PA officials also acknowledged that they faced an aggressive schedule to complete various planned activities for workforce management, training, and other efforts, in support of full implementation, and that they may not be able to complete all efforts as thoroughly as they would like in order to expedite the transition of the PA program to the new delivery model in 2018. FEMA's new PA information system is designed to resolve past challenges, but opportunities exist to fully implement key information technology (IT) management controls. For example, FAC-Trax is a web-based information system that allows FEMA staff and applicants to review, manage, and track current PA projects. FAC-Trax is critical to the new delivery model",
    "gao_GAO-18-409": "Why GAO Did This Study The Pipeline Safety Trust, a federal agency within the Department of Transportation, oversees pipeline operators' compliance with federal odorization requirements. The Pipeline Safety -Safety of Gas Gathering Pipelines rulemaking would require pipeline operators to odorize all gas transported by pipelines in high consequence areas. The Pipeline Integrity Management Program for Transmission Pipelines, a component of PHMSA's gas integrity management program, requires pipeline operators to assess the integrity of their pipelines in high consequence areas. The Pipeline Integrity Management Program also requires pipeline operators to proactively take measures to reduce the risk or potential impact of an accident. The Pipeline Safety -Safety of Gas Gathering Pipelines rulemaking, if approved, will provide PHMSA with more data on pipeline infrastructure and incident data. This report examines (1) the advantages and disadvantages of odorizing gas in pipelines, (2) the need to modify federal pipeline odorization requirements, and (3) the extent to which PHMSA's gas integrity management program is sufficient for pipelines in high consequence areas. GAO reviewed federal pipeline safety regulations and surveyed pipeline safety officials from 49 states and the District of Columbia. GAO also interviewed federal and state pipeline safety officials and industry stakeholders. What GAO Found Officials and stakeholders GAO interviewed and the state pipeline safety officials GAO surveyed said that odorizing gas in pipelines improves public safety, but can impede some industrial processes. The primary disadvantage of odorizing gas in pipelines is the need to remove the odorant for some industrial processes. Officials from both federal safety regulatory agencies and state pipeline safety officials surveyed said that removing the odorant can cause an adverse chemical reaction during processing for some industries. For example, sulfur in natural gas can be detrimental in the production of electricity, fertilizer, and glass because it interferes with the catalyst used during production. However, some stakeholders said that odorizing gas in transmission pipelines could be technically challenging. For example, odorizing all gas transported in transmission pipelines would require tens of thousands of odorization facilities. However, requiring all pipelines to be odorized at the federal level would have to be consistent with federal pipeline safety regulations. According to PHMSA officials, the data collected will inform PHMSA on the best path forward regarding further regulation of gas gathering pipelines, including the need for odor",

IRS's ISAC is intended to improve collaboration and information sharing among IRS, states, and industry partners. GAO was asked to review IRS's ISAC. This report (1) describes actions IRS is taking to implement the ISAC and RRT, (2) evaluates the extent to which the ISAC aligns with leading practices for pilot design, and (3) identifies actions, if any, that IRS could take to improve the ISAC pilot. GAO reviewed IRS documents and interviewed IRS officials and industry partners. GAO also conducted four focus groups with state and industry officials. What GAO Found The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) implemented the Identity Theft Tax Refund Fraud-Information Sharing and Analysis Center (ISAC) in 2017 to facilitate information sharing among IRS, state, and industry partners\u2014subject to disclosure prohibitions\u2014by launching an online platform, establishing a governance structure, and recruiting members. IRS and state officials and industry representatives attributed increased trust and improved relationships to IRS's efforts in recent years. Additionally, IRS coordinated with state and industry partners to establish the Rapid Response Team (RRT) in 2016, which has been initiated once thus far in 2017. IRS's efforts partially align with five leading practices for pilot design. For example, IRS identified and integrated lessons learned into its ISAC pilot. However, IRS has not translated its objectives into specific, researchable questions that articulate what will be assessed. IRS officials said they are still learning about the five leading practices for pilot design, and the ISAC at least partially aligns with each one.

    "gao_GAO-18-693T": "Why GAO Did This Study The federal government is responsible for managing the nation's energy infrastructure, including natural gas, oil, and natural gas exploration and development. The permitting process is a critical component of the permitting process, which is intended to ensure that the U.S. economy and the national interest are protected from waste, fraud, and abuse. This testimony discusses factors that affect the length of federal permitting reviews and the extent to which federal agencies have implemented a number of GAO recommendations. This statement is based on prior GAO reports and selected updates conducted in February 2013 and August 2013. For the updates, GAO reviewed agency documents and interviewed agency officials. What GAO Found In prior work, GAO identified a range of factors that can affect the length of federal energy infrastructure permitting reviews. For the purposes of this statement, GAO has categorized the factors into five broad categories: (1) coordination and communication, (2) human capital, (3) collecting and analyzing accurate milestone information, (4) incomplete applications, and (5) significant policy changes. Effective coordination and communication between agencies and applicants is a critical factor in an efficient and timely permitting process. For example, in GAO's February 2013 review of natural gas pipeline permitting, GAO reported that virtually all applications for pipeline projects require some level of coordination with one or more federal agencies, as well as others, to satisfy requirements for environmental review. For example, in a February 2013 review of natural gas pipeline permitting, GAO reported that virtually all applications for pipeline projects require some level of coordination with one or more federal agencies, as well as others, to satisfy requirements for environmental review. Agencies can also use mechanisms to streamline reviews of projects that are routine or less environmentally risky. For example, under the Natural Resources Policy Act, agencies may categorically exclude actions that an agency has found\u2014in the National Environmental Policy Act procedures adopted by the agency\u2014do not individually or cumulatively have a significant effect on the human environment and for which, therefore, neither an environmental assessment nor an environmental impact statement is required. Also under the National Environmental Policy Act, agencies may rely on \u201ctiering,\u201d in which broader, earlier NEPA reviews are incorporated into subsequent site-specific analyses. Such a mechanism can reduce the number of required agency reviews and shorten the permitting process. Human capital Agency and industry representatives cited human capital factors as affecting the length of permitting reviews. Such factors include having a sufficient number of experts to review",

The Advisory Board on Toxic Substances and Worker Health (Advisory Board) is tasked with providing specific technical advice to DOL regarding Part E of EEOICPA. GAO was asked to review the Advisory Board's work. This report examines (1) the number of claims for illnesses resulting from exposure to toxins that were reopened by DOL and their final outcome; (2) the extent to which an advisory board on toxic substances and worker health reviewed and advised DOL on the scientific soundness of DOL's database on toxins and their potential links to occupational diseases, and DOL's response; and (3) the extent to which an advisory board on toxic substances and worker health reviewed and advised DOL on the scientific soundness of DOL's database on toxins and their potential links to occupational diseases, and DOL's response. GAO reviewed relevant federal laws, regulations, and guidance; analyzed DOL data on claims that were reopened from 2012 through 2017; and interviewed DOL officials and others with relevant knowledge or experience of the program. What GAO Found The Department of Labor (DOL) reopened more than 7,000 claims filed by contracted Energy employees from 2012 through 2017, and approved 69 percent of these claims. Among those more than 7,000 claims, DOL initiated most of the reopenings (80 percent) itself, with fewer reopenings initiated by claimants. Regardless of a claim's previous status of approved or denied, outcomes after reopening varied by who initiated the reopening. DOL officials provided data showing that most of the claims reopened from 2012 through 2017 that were subsequently denied compensation had common reasons, including insufficient medical evidence, ineligible survivors, or maximum benefits already met. In its 2015 Annual Report to Congress, the Office of the Ombudsman noted claimants' concerns about the reopening process. In particular, the Ombudsman found that DOL's written communication with claimants requesting additional evidence or informing them of the final decision did not clearly explain what specific evidence was needed or why previously submitted evidence was deemed insufficient.

DOD reports that the ANDSF has improved in several capability areas, but they continue to face critical capability gaps, impeding their ability to maintain security and stability in Afghanistan independent of U.S. and coalition forces. GAO was asked to review the ANDSF's capabilities and capacity. This report (1) describes what has been reported about the ANDSF's capabilities and capability gaps and (2) provides illustrative examples of information DOD has about the ANDSF's ability to operate and maintain U.S.-purchased equipment. GAO reviewed DOD and NATO reports and documents, and interviewed DOD officials in the United States and Afghanistan. What GAO Found Since the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2017, the Afghan National Defense and Security Forces (ANDSF) have reported improving some capabilities related to the functional areas and capability pillars described above, but face several capability gaps that leave them reliant on coalition assistance. DOD and the ANDSF have begun implementing plans and initiatives that aim to strengthen the ANDSF's capabilities, such as the AndSF Roadmap, which is structured to span 4 years. DOD collects some reliable information about the operation and maintenance abilities of the ANDSF specialized forces, in part because advisors are embedded at the tactical level with the specialized forces, according to DOD officials. Specifically, U.S. and coalition forces advise specialized forces at the tactical level under Resolute Support because building ANDSF aviation and special operations abilities are considered particularly important. DOD officials told GAO that since U.S. and coalition forces are embedded at the tactical level for specialized forces, they can monitor, assess, and report on tactical abilities, including the ability to operate and maintain equipment. DOD officials told GAO that since U.S. and coalition forces are embedded at the tactical level for specialized forces, they can monitor, assess, and report on tactical abilities, including the ability to operate and maintain equipment. DOD officials told GAO that they do not assess conventional forces' tactical abilities because advisors have had little or no direct contact with conventional units below the corps and zone levels, and thus do not collect such information on conventional forces. Moreover, DOD lacks reliable information about the degree to which conventional forces",

CBP uses a network of roads to conduct its operations, including roads owned by other federal, state, local, tribal, and private landowners. GAO was asked to review CBP's use of roads. This report examines (1) the extent to which CBP has authorities and arrangements for using and maintaining roads, and (2) the extent to which CBP has documented and shared its processes and criteria for funding non-owned roads. GAO reviewed relevant laws, policies, and procedures of three federal departments and agencies that maintain roads owned by others (non-owned roads) for their operations\u2014the Department of Defense (DOD), the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), and the Department of the Interior (DOI). GAO interviewed officials from CBP, the Department of Defense, the U.S. Forest Service, and the Bureau of Indian Affairs. GAO also reviewed relevant laws, policies, and procedures of three other departments that maintain roads owned by others (non-owned roads) for their operations\u2014the Department of Defense (DOD), the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), and the Department of the Interior (DOI). GAO also interviewed officials from nine southwest Border Patrol sectors, selected based on geographic location and other factors. What GAO Found The U.S. Border Patrol (Border Patrol) generally has access to public roads to the same extent as other users, and has certain authorities to use other federal, state, local, tribal, and private roads. According to local, tribal, and Border Patrol sector officials, CBP uses and is sometimes the primary user of roads owned by states, counties, cities, and localities, but does not have a specific appropriation to engage in public improvements, including the maintenance and repair of such roads it uses for border security operations. CBP uses Comprehensive Tactical Infrastructure Maintenance and Repair (CTIMR) contracts to address maintenance of roads, as well as all other TI it uses for its operations, through CBP's Comprehensive Tactical Infrastructure Maintenance and Repair (CTIMR) contracts and agreements. CBP enters into various arrangements with federal, state, and local agencies and with some private landowners to maintain the roads it uses for its operations; however, it has not consistently documented its arrangements",

In 2010, the United States, Caribbean Community member states, and the Dominican Republic launched CBSI to strengthen regional cooperation on security. CBSI's aim was to increase citizen safety through provision of U.S. foreign assistance to CBSI partner countries to reduce illicit trafficking, improve public safety and security, and promote social justice. GAO was asked to review CBSI. This report (1) provides information on U.S. funding for CBSI activities, (2) examines the extent to which State and USAID have implemented a planning and reporting process for CBSI, and (3) examines the extent to which State and USAID have established objectives and performance indicators to measure the progress of their CBSI activities. GAO analyzed U.S. and Caribbean government data for fiscal years 2010 through 2018, reviewed relevant documents, and interviewed officials in Washington, D.C., and in Barbados, the Dominican Republic, and Jamaica. What GAO Found From fiscal years 2010 through 2018, the U.S. government has allocated more than $560 million in funding for the Caribbean Basin Security Initiative (CBSI). Since fiscal year 2012, annual allocations have remained relatively constant, ranging between $56.6 million and $63.5 million. Of the 13 CBSI partner countries, U.S. agencies have provided the most CBSI funding to the Dominican Republic, Jamaica, and the countries covered by the Eastern Caribbean embassy. State and USAID disbursed funds to support activities in partner countries that improve law enforcement and maritime interdiction capabilities, support activities to train and otherwise improve the capabilities of national security institutions, prevent crime and violence, and deter and detect border criminal activity. These activities are generally aligned with the three pillars of CBSI. The United States and Caribbean countries meet periodically to set strategic goals and to designate high-level priorities for the subsequent year, and U.S. agencies individually plan and report on CBSI activities on a country-specific basis through a variety of reporting mechanisms. However, State has not created an initiative-wide mechanism for planning and reporting on CBSI activities and the U.S. government cannot assess initiative-wide progress. State and USAID set strategic goals and prioritized CBSI activities with partner countries and plan for and report on CBSI activities within each agency or bureau. However",

EEOC requires private-sector firms with 50 or more employees to report data on the racial/ethnic and gender characteristics of employees. GAO was asked to review workforce diversity in the financial services industry. This report examines (1) trends in management-level diversity in the financial services industry, (2) trends in diversity among potential talent pools, and (3) challenges financial services firms identified in trying to increase workforce diversity and practices firms used to increase workforce diversity. GAO obtained and analyzed 2007\u20132015 workforce data from EEOC and interviewed representatives from 13 financial services firms and organizations that advocate for the financial services industry, women or racial/ethnic minorities, or both. GAO also interviewed representatives from 9 of the 13 financial services firms and 9 organizations that advocate for the financial services industry. What GAO Found Management-level diversity in the financial services industry showed a continued upward trend from GAO's 2006 report, the first of a series of reports on trends in the financial services industry, in which data showed that management-level representation by minorities increased from 11.1 percent to 15.5 percent from 1993 through 2004. Minorities' representation among senior-level managers increased by 1.7 percentage points during this time. Women's representation at the overall management level has remained at about 45 percent from 2007 through 2015. Among the various sectors of the financial services industry, the insurance sector has consistently had the highest proportion of women in management positions while the banks and other credit institutions sector has consistently had the highest proportion of racial/ethnic minorities in management. As the size of financial services firms increase (by number of employees), the representation of minorities in overall management increased and the representation of women in overall management was generally the same. Additionally, management-level diversity in the financial services sector has similarities and differences compared to other sectors. Representatives from financial services firms and other stakeholders described many of the same challenges in recruiting and retaining women and racial/ethnic minorities as GAO has previously reported, including negative perceptions of the financial services industry that might discourage potential candidates. Practices that financial services firms use to address these challenges include broadening recruitment efforts, establishing relationships with student groups and professional organizations, and providing training on unconscious bias. Representatives from all of the financial services firms GAO met with agreed on",

GAO was asked to review government-wide reporting of fees, fines, and penalties. This report examines (1) the extent to which government-wide data on collections of fees, fines, and penalties are publicly available and useful for the purpose of congressional oversight, and (2) the benefits and challenges to government-wide reporting of specific fees, fines, and penalties including data elements that facilitate congressional oversight. GAO reviewed OMB and Treasury data, and other sources of data on collections of fees, fines, and penalties, and interviewed staff from congressional committees on appropriations, budget, and oversight. What GAO Found The Office of Management and Budget (OMB), the Department of the Treasury (Treasury), and agencies publicly report some data on collections of fees, fines, and penalties, but the data have significant limitations. OMB reports budgetary and financial data in various parts of the Budget of the U.S. Government, including Analytical Perspectives, the Budget Appendix, and the Public Budget Database. Treasury reports financial data in the Combined Statement. Each source provides information for a broader purpose than reporting on collections of fees, fines, and penalties.

FSA shares PII with non-school partners, such as loan servicers, guaranty agencies, and private collection agencies, to assist them in carrying out their functions. GAO was asked to review FSA's oversight of non-school partners' protection of student aid data. This report (1) describes the roles of FSA's non-school partners in the federal student financial aid program, including the types of personally identifiable information shared with them; and (2) assesses the extent to which FSA's policies and procedures for overseeing non-school partners' protection of federal student aid data align with federal requirements, federal guidance, and best practices. GAO reviewed FSA documents and interviewed FSA officials. What GAO Found The Office of Federal Student Aid's (FSA) non-school partners play key roles in the federal student financial aid program, particularly with regard to the servicing, repayment, and collection of student loans. These partners include loan servicers, guaranty agencies, and private collection agencies. FSA shares PII with these partners to assist them in carrying out their functions. FSA has established policies and procedures for overseeing its non-school partners' protection of the personally identifiable information that it shares with the partners. These policies and procedures vary in the extent to which they address the key practices for overseeing the protection of PII. For example, FSA's policies and procedures for Title IV loan servicers and private collection agencies fully address three of the four key practices that pertain to loan servicers and private collection agencies. However, FSA's procedures for guaranty agencies do not require monitoring controls on an ongoing basis. Finally, for FFEL lenders, FSA has minimal oversight procedures. FSA's limited oversight could result in inconsistent or ineffective implementation of security controls, which in turn could have serious consequences for the privacy of millions of borrowers whose information is shared with non-school partners.",

HUD's lead grant programs and its two largest rental assistance programs serve the most families with children. GAO was asked to review HUD's lead grant programs. This report examines HUD's efforts to (1) incorporate statutory requirements and other relevant federal standards in its lead grant programs; (2) monitor and enforce compliance with lead paint regulations for its rental assistance programs; (3) adopt federal health guidelines and environmental standards for lead hazards in its lead grant and rental assistance programs; and (4) measure and report on its performance related to making housing lead-safe. GAO reviewed relevant laws, regulations, and HUD documents; analyzed HUD's grant data from 2013 through 2017; and interviewed HUD staff and officials from HUD's Office of Lead Hazard Control and Healthy Homes (Lead Office), Office of Public and Indian Housing (PIH), and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). What GAO Found The Department of Housing and Urban Development's (HUD) Lead-Based Paint Hazard Control grant and the Lead Hazard Reduction Demonstration grant programs have incorporated relevant statutory requirements and other relevant federal standards in their grant programs. For example, HUD's 2017 funding notices require applicants to demonstrate that they meet certain requirements, such as being a state or local jurisdiction. HUD has also established processes for reviewing and scoring grant applications and awarding funds. However, HUD has not fully documented or evaluated its lead grant processes in reviewing and scoring grant applications and making award decisions. For example, HUD's internal memorandums did not document the rationale for award decisions or provide information sufficient to help applicants understand award outcomes. Additionally, HUD has not changed the threshold criteria used to make award decisions since 2003. HUD has begun to develop analyses and tools to inform its efforts to target outreach and ensure that grant awards go to areas of the country at risk for lead paint hazards. However, HUD has not developed time frames for incorporating the results of its model to help better identify areas at risk for lead paint hazards.

The Act also required VA to submit a plan to Congress and GAO within 90 days of enactment. This testimony discusses VA's appeals plan and supplemental materials, and assesses the extent to which VA's appeals plan addresses the Act's required elements. This statement is based on GAO's March 2017 report, Veterans Appeals Improvement and Modernization: VA's Appeals Plan Against Required Elements (GAO-17-92). GAO reviewed VA's appeals plan and supplemental materials, and interviewed VA officials. What GAO Found The Veterans Appeals Improvement and Modernization Act of 2017 (the Act) requires the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) to develop a comprehensive plan for implementing the new and legacy disability appeals processes. VA's appeals plan addresses 17 of the Act's 22 required elements, partially addresses 4 related to monitoring implementation and workforce planning, and does not address 1 element related to identifying total resources. For example, VA's appeals plan addresses the required elements related to, among other things, identifying legal authorities for hiring and removing employees, estimating timeliness for hiring and training employees, and outlining the outreach VA expects to conduct. However, VA's appeals plan does not address all 22 of the Act's required elements. For example, VA's appeals plan does not articulate a set of goals and measures that cover all aspects of its new appeals process, such as accuracy of decisions and cost. VA's appeals plan also does not articulate how it will monitor processing of legacy appeals and how it will track both sets of workloads. VA's appeals plan reflects certain aspects of sound planning practices related to managing the implementation of process change; however, other key components are not addressed. For example, VA's appeals plan does not include a master schedule that reflects key activities, such as identifying the time frames for completion of key activities, and does not include information on the total resources required for this reform effort. Until VA has a robust integrated master schedule, supported by detailed project plans that adhere to sound practices, VA's appeals plan does not provide reasonable assurance that decision makers have the essential"
